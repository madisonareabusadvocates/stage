<h2 align=center>Joint Position on Downtown Badger Bus Terminal <a href="../misc/BadgerDepot4.pdf">(PDF)</a></h2>
<h5>April 25, 2009</h5>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left">
The States Connections 2030 Plan and Dane Countys Transport 2020 Plan call for greatly expanded mass transit passing through downtown Madison in the next few years, but fail to plan for the downtown terminal itself.
</p>
<p align="left">
Instead, the present Badger Bus depot would be redeveloped. When Madison finally decides to have centrally-located terminals, it will find that the current bus station was preempted by short-sighted commercial redevelopment as was the nearby train station before it. 
</p>
<p align="left">
What should we do?  Postpone the redevelopment plan until the issue of a downtown station is adequately addressed. Badger Bus is a private company that has profited from public infrastructure and public patronage for decades, and therefore owes the city consideration for its transportation needs. But so far, Badger Bus owners have failed to offer any viable plan for future service. After the planned demolition of its depot, Badger Bus intends to rely even more on UW facilities, but the university never planned for inter-city buses and there is no plan at all for Greyhound buses although Greyhound presently uses the Badger Bus terminal.
</p><p align="left">
Before review by the City Planning Commission and the Common Council,
<div style="text-align: left;">
<ul>
   <li>	Badger Bus owners should obtain an agreement with UW planners regarding any expected use of University facilities.</li>
   <li>	City Planners and State and Federal Transportation Planners should show plans for downtown intercity terminals.</li>
<ul>
</div>
<p align="left">   
The Mayor and Common Council should consider the purchase of this site for public transportation purposes, if necessary under eminent domain, and apply for State and Federal funding.
