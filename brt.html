<h1>The Metro Mover<a href="TheMover2013.pdf"> (PDF)</a> </h1>
<p>The Madison Area needs Rapid Buses. We call our vision the M or Metro Mover. The
   region is too large to be served adequately by only one type of bus.
   Existing buses are important, but there also needs to be a way for transit
   to connect places outside the center in a reasonable period of time.
   Despite its lakes and isthmus, the City of Madison has clearly defined corridors
   for good rapid transit. Below is the beginning of a simple schema, the idea being that a pedestrian
   on East Washington Avenue should be able to easily get to Monona Drive, Park
   Street, University Avenue, Mineral Point Road, or State Street quickly and
   comfortably without a car. The alternative is deep, plentiful, and expensive
   roads and parking garages.</p>

<h2>Why Rapid Buses?</h2>
<p>In the Madison Area, express or rapid buses give us the most service for our money
   given our relatively small size. 10 to 15 minute service is really
   the minimum frequency for a bus, as longer headways mean people need to plan
   their trips with schedules. Most people are reluctant to do that. Features that can make buses       especially RAPID include signal preemption, limited stops, special
   lanes along part of the line, and level boarding. In time, ridership
   could grow and potentially justify an upgrade to rail.</p>
<p>Although the map emphasizes the City of Madison and areas of possible Transit Oriented       Infill, the M also has the potential to provide green transportation
   to Madison’s surrounding communities. The Red Line could be extended to Sun Prairie and    Verona; the Blue Line to Fitchburg, McFarland, and Stoughton,
   and the yellow Line to Middleton and Waunakee.</p>
<p>Many American cities have or are planning express or rapid bus lines. They are 
   not the usual bus lines. They are a high capacity transit mode designed to be competitive with driving.
   Imaging is important, and while vehicles could be standard 40’ diesel
   buses, they could also be articulated buses, electric trolleybuses, CNG powered
   buses, hybrid electric buses, or some combination of these. The rapid bus
   system could interface with other transit lines at various locations, making transit
   a convincing choice for a significant fraction of the population.</p>
<p>Investment in transit has the potential to provide green jobs and to reduce
   traffic congestion on Madison’s arterials. The goal is for transit to become a popular,
   convenient and economical way to travel.</p>
