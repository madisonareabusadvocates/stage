<h3>Transit Board Approves Metro Bus Route Changes (second Edition)</h3>
<strong></strong><br/>
<br/>
<em>ELIZABETH WACHOWSKI<br/>
Wis. State Journal</em>
<p>Tues. May 23, 2006
<p>
The Transit and Parking Commission unanimously passed sweeping service changes to Metro Transit after a public hearing Monday night.
<p>
However, after hearing testimony from several riders who said the changes hurt them, the commission left room for small changes in the proposed routes at the discretion of the Metro Transit.
<p>
The changes mainly affect routes on the western and southern parts of Metro's service area. Major adjustments include the splitting of Route 6 past the West Transfer Point into two new routes, faster commuter routes to Downtown from Middleton and suburban areas, and more direct service between the southern and western areas and Downtown.
<p>
According to Metro general manager Catherine Debo, the changes should save Metro $500,000 in the next year, making up a little less than half of its projected deficit. The rest of the money will come from fares and surrounding community contributions, she said.
<p>
About 40 people attended a question and answer session and public hearing to discuss the changes before the vote Monday. Most of the speakers said that while they liked the idea of faster service, they had specific problems with changes on routes that they used frequently.
<p>
Cathy Casper said that as a bus rider near the Allied Drive area, she has to deal with violence both at the bus stops and on the buses themselves.
<p>
"Now, to add to these insults ... they're making significant changes to route 18 and 19 by where I live," Casper said.
<p>
According to Casper, switching Route 18 to Allied Drive, instead of Red Arrow Trail and Crescent Road, will put many elderly people in the area at risk of encountering violence at the Allied Drive stops.
<p>
She also disagreed with some of the service changes to Route 19. While running the buses earlier in the morning is good for people who have early jobs, she said, cuts in service in mid-afternoon hurts those who work later shifts.
<p>
Alta Jewell said that she wishes there was a bus line that allowed access to UW Hospital from the west. Route 9, which goes to the hospital complex, approaches from Downtown.
<p>
"I have never been in a city where buses do not serve their hospitals," Jewell said.
<p>
Ald. Ken Golden, a member of the commission, told Jewell that since the area around the hospital was in the town of Shorewood Hills, it would be difficult to fund a line that approaches the hospital from the west. Shorewood Hills doesn't participate in the Metro Transit system.
<p>
Other speakers told the commission that they supported the changes. Activist and formal mayoral candidate Bert Zipperer called the new plan "fabulous" for families on the South Side, who now have more options to get Downtown.
<p>
Arbor Hills Neighborhood Association President Sheri Carter thanked Metro Transit for moving bus service off the narrow lanes of Todd Drive, where, she said, the noise from the buses came in through every open window in the neighborhood.
<p>
The service changes should go into effect Aug. 27.</p>
