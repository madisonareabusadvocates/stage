Metro Transit is implementing several route and schedule changes today, affecting riders in the city and town of Madison, Middleton, Fitchburg and on the UW campus.
<p>
In Fitchburg, service will be provided to the Fitchburg Center business park, said Julie Maryott-Walsh, marketing and customer service manager for Metro Transit.
<p>
In Middleton, more routes will be available to businesses west of the Beltline and during peak hours north of Highway 14 and west of Parmenter Street, she said.
<p>
Also, better connections will be available to Middleton's Greenway Station, the west transfer point and the Prairie Towne Center on Madison's Far West Side.
<p>
Two new transfer opportunities in Middleton will be at University Avenue and Branch Street and Century Avenue near Northbrook Drive.
<p>
A new route on the UW campus will go into the Park Street and Regent Street neighborhoods, serving UW's new Newell J. Smith Hall dormitory and new buildings on the south side of campus, Maryott-Walsh said.
<p>
Metro is not expanding service in the town or city of Madison, but it is streamlining some routes as a way to reduce commuter travel time, she said.
