<h2>Metros Definition of Trip is Not What You Think</h2>
<h4>Susan De Vos, Jan. 3, 2010</h4>


Do you think that a bus ride or trip means a journey by bus between two points?  Not if you are Metro.  Consider for instance Metro's claim that ridership is increasing.  If you break up a bus ride so it requires a transfer, count the same journey as two trips instead of one, and then claim that your ridership has increased, are you simply playing with statistics or showing an actual increase in ridership?  Metro has been requiring that more and more trips involve a transfer, and  then turns around and claims that it recently experienced its highest ridership in 30 years (13,433,149 rides in 2008). How do you interpret that claim?
<p>
Educators are constantly trying to get people to understand statistics but, as you can see, they are not particularly successful.  Decades ago, when I took my first statistics course in college, our class was required to read a little book entitled How to Lie With Statistics.  We then saw examples of how statistics were being misused all the time, especially by journalists and government officials who did not understand the nuances involved.  Being college educated was supposed to mean that we knew better.  As I do not teach statistics now, I have to wonder if students are asked to read something comparable these days.  I have to wonder if they are being exposed to the frequent misuse of a potentially powerful tool.  One has to wonder because of the way Metro proudly exhibits its ignorance.   

<p>
What is actually the case, and what statistics are used to claim something, are not necessarily the same thing.  What has happened to counting rides is very similar to what has happened to the way the Labor Department calculates an unemployment rate.  That rate is actually a ratio that depends on what is used in the numerator and denominator.  We all know that with unemployment, the numerator no longer reflects people out of work, only people who were looking for work in the last two weeks.  We all know that people who have either given up looking for work or who are <b>under</b>employed but not strictly <b>un</b>employed are not counted. So people tell us what the official unemployment rate is but also that it is an underestimate of the true rate.  The same holds true for the artificial definition of "ridership" and "trip."  Do you think it legitimate to compare an unemployment rate calculated earlier under the old definition with a rate of the same name calculated later under the new definition, or would that be comparing apples and oranges?   Do you think it legitimate to compare ridership before and after a transfer was required for the same trip?
