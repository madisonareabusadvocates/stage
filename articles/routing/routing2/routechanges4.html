Metro Transit will be implementing a number of route and schedule changes Sunday. Service changes will affect riders on most routes in the cities of Madison, Middleton and Fitchburg, the town of Madison and UW campus.

Metro Transit said the changes are intended to help current and prospective riders understand and navigate the system more easily, enhance transfer opportunities at transfer points, provide expanded service in Fitchburg and Middleton, reduce commuter travel time and improve operating efficiencies to help control costs.

Metro's new System Map and Ride Guide are available on the Internet at mymetrobus.com, as well as onboard Metro buses, the Madison Department of Transportation and all Madison public libraries.
