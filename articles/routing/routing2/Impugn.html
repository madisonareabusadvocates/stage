Dear Editor: There is no reason to impugn the source of Madison Metro's ridership figures, as Susan De Vos did in a recent letter.
<p>
In 2007 Metro did achieve its second-highest ridership tallies in the last 25 years. When we count rides, we count all "unlinked" trips as defined by federal guidelines.
<p>
If a rider swipes a ride pass as issued by the University of Wisconsin, for example, that counts as a ride. If that rider transfers to another bus and swipes the pass again, that also counts as a ride.
<p>
Before the ride passes, a fare-paying rider would be given a transfer ticket at no cost. That's still the case for riders without a ride pass card. Those transfers have always been counted as separate "unlinked"
trips. Nothing has changed.
<p>
As routes and schedules evolve, some trips now require a transfer that previously didn't. Other trips that previously required a transfer can now be done on one bus.
<p>
There is no basis for the insinuation that the ridership numbers were intended to mislead.
<p>
At a time when energy prices are forcing a re-evaluation of how we get around, we should celebrate that our data show we have a public transportation option growing in popularity.
<p>
As fuel costs move toward $4 a gallon, it is clear that increasing the number of road lanes and parking ramps for single-occupancy vehicles is building for the past. We need to build on Metro's track record and
positive image to maintain the political will to expand its ability to provide public transportation.
