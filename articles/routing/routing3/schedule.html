According to Metro, the changes were meant to create more consistent route patterns and schedules, enhance transfer opportunities, reduce commuter travel times and improve operating efficiencies to help control costs.<p>In my experience, however, the bus system is less efficient now because many buses operate less frequently and many destinations are reached by fewer buses than before.<p>For example, my husband's doctor works in Dean Clinic West. This building is located at the intersection of Old Sauk and High Point roads on the west side. Before Aug. 27, four buses (6, 8, 15 and 62) came from various directions to that location. On weekday mornings and early afternoons, a bus came at least once every 30 minutes.<p>But since the schedule has been modified, now only bus No. 15 serves that location. For most of each day, that bus only passes the Dean Clinic once per hour. Now my husband has to decide whether to find a new doctor or spend half the day commuting to his appointments.<p>This problem does not only affect destinations on the edges of the city. It also affects State Street, located in one of Madison's busiest neighborhoods. Since cars are not allowed there, many people catch the bus to go there.<p>Despite this, with the new schedule, fewer buses pass through that way.<p>It seems that in attempting to reduce its costs, Madison Metro has also reduced the quality of its services. This is not a good solution because the inconvenience of the new schedule will probably cause many people to ride the bus less often, or not to ride the bus at all. The city should instead work to improve the bus system so that more people will want to use it.	<p>Sakti Suryani<br/>Madison</p><a href="index.html">Back to Articles</a></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p><footer class="footer">
