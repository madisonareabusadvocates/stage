Seeing its highest ridership in 25 years, Metro Transit is proposing service changes to ease crowding on buses and make them more on time.
<p>
Metro, which has faced budget strains due mainly to rising fuel prices, has restructured routes three times since 2000, each time including service cuts as part of the package.
<p>
But that's put more riders on bus routes with fewer hours of service, which is filling some buses to capacity and making it harder to meet schedules.
<p>
"We were trying to do too much with too little," said Sharon Persich, Metro's planning and scheduling manager.
<p>
Now Metro is proposing a series of changes that will add a net 33 hours of service to the system each day, which should ease problems, especially on the central Isthmus where crowding is worst, Persich said.
<p>
Metro has not yet developed a plan on how to pay for changes.
<p>
"It's a city issue," Persich said. "It's going to have to be addressed on that level."
<p>
Mayor Dave Cieslewicz, pleased ridership is increasing and that Metro is addressing crowding and scheduling concerns, said he hasn't seen cost estimates for the changes but is hopeful the moves won't be expensive.
<p>
"I don't know what 30 hours means in terms of cost," he said. "Raising fares, that's something I'm reluctant to do."
<p>
<b>OUTLINING PROPOSAL TODAY</b>
<p>
Metro staff will outline draft proposals before the city Transit and Parking Commission at 5 p.m. today at the Madison Municipal Building. The commission will consider the proposals and likely set a public hearing for April. Changes could be made a soon as this summer.
<p>
Commission Chairman Carl Durocher was cautious about offering comment because he hasn't seen the draft proposals, but said, "I want to see us provide as attractive and convenient public transit system as possible in Madison."
<p>
Boosted by the use of unlimited ride passes by UW-Madison and others, Metro attracted 12.7 million riders last year, the second-highest total in system history after the 13.2 million peak in 1982, Persich said.
<p>
Since 2000, the system has added 1.6 million annual rides in the campus area alone, Persich said.
<p>
"We are still ascending," she said.
<p>
But cost-cutting and service efficiencies and reductions have hurt, she said.
<p>
Buses on Route 6, the backbone of the system that runs from East Towne to West Towne, are running on too tight a schedule, Persich said. Routes on Monroe Street, Gorham and Ingersoll streets, East Washington Avenue, Johnson Street and University Avenue, for example, have lost more than 200 daily trips since 2000.
<p>
On some routes, filled buses must pass people at stops, while heavy ridership has made it hard for drivers to keep up with the schedules, she said.
<p>
Meanwhile, new bus designs have meant fewer seats and less standing room, and automated fare box requirements make boarding slower, she said.
<p>
<b>RESTORING ROUTES</b>
<P>
The proposed changes - a mix of new service and some efficiencies - would make a difference, Persich said.
<p>
Metro wants to revamp Route 6, return popular routes that bypassed Capitol Square and connected the east Isthmus and campus, and improve service to the airport, Madison Area Technical College and more.
<p>
"This is an expansion, there's no question about it," Persich said.
<p>
Metro, however, is constrained because it's using all its buses and has no extra garage space for more.
<p>
Durocher is concerned about putting too much pressure on drivers, who've struggled to meet schedules especially through a tough winter.
<p>
<b>'UNAPPEALING OPTIONS'</b>
<p>
It's still unclear where the city will find money for the new service.
<p>
Metro's overall budget increased $1.17 million to $48.7 million in 2008. The city's share for fixed-route service rose $342,000, but due to a $679,000 cut in paratransit funding, net city funding for the system fell $337,400 to $9.8 million this year.
<p>
"We have a series of unappealing options," Durocher said. "We don't want to raise fares. We don't want to ask the taxpayers."
<p>

In recent years, the city has turned toward generating revenue by selling more advertising on buses, but that move has been controversial.
<p>
"I'm trying to avoid any of those three bad choices," Cieslewicz said. "The long-range hope for stabilizing public transit," Durocher said, "is the development of a regional transit authority."\ \DRAFT METRO TRANSIT CHANGE HIGHLIGHTS*
