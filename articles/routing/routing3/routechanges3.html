She doesn't have a car because of the price she'd have to pay.<p>"Gas prices, the use of all the fuel," she says.<p>But high gas prices have left Madison Metro driving on a tight budget and has fueled changes to its bus service.<p>"We'd prefer not to do cut cut cut cut cut, we would prefer to find efficiency in the system than do that," says Catherine Debo, Metro's General Manager.<p>Metro plans to make routes more simple, iron out excess loops, cut routes with the least ridership and paste them to routes that need more service.<p>But several residents, including Sarto, say the new service will not necessarily be easier.<p>"The problem is everyone thinks people only work 9 to 5 and a lot of us work evenings weekends and other times than the buses can be conveniently available," says Sarto.<p>For Sarto, the changes mean she can't get to work on time.<p>"Negotiate with my employers to get a Taxi and have it pick me up and I don't know if they'll do that or not," she says.<p>Metro says these are just proposed routes and are working with residents, going neighborhood to neighborhood, to make sure riders, like Sarto, aren't left behind.<p>"we won't be able to address all concerns, but we think we'll be able to address most concerns and have a better service," says Debo.<p>"I really think Madison Metro is really doing its best job it can and I'd like to see it do even better," says Sarto.<p>Riders do have the power to change the proposed routes.<p>Metro wants to get input and will hold dozens of neighborhood meetings.<p>Madison's Transit and Parking Commission will hold a public hearing in May or June, then vote on final changes.<p>New routes and schedules take effect either at the end of August or beginning of September.</p><a href="index.html">Back to Articles</a></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p><footer class="footer">
