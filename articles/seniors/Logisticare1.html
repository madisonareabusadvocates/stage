<h2>LogistiCare transit system aims to save money in Wisconsin by reducing riders</h2>
<h4><strong>No transit for you!<br/>
Isthmus| The Daily Page, June 16, 2011<br/>
By Joe Tarr</strong></h4>

<p>Susan Lampe fears that thousands of Wisconsinites will soon lose not only a ride to the doctor, but also the right to pick their health care providers.</p>

<p>Beginning July 1, the state is scheduled to begin using an out-of-state company, Atlanta-based LogistiCare, to arrange rides for people receiving medical assistance, taking this role over from county governments. The company, which has set up a call center in Madison, provides this service in other states.</p>

<p>Critics say the company makes money by denying rides to as many people as possible. When a ride is requested, clients are reportedly asked a series of questions, such as whether they can walk, take a bus or have a family member drive them.</p>

<p>The system is expected to save the state about $5 million over two years.</p>

<p>"Their goal is to get people on free transportation and then possibly reimburse people for a bus pass," says Lampe, a disabled client who lives in downtown Madison. "It's going to be a real uneven set of circumstances because some people don't have family or friends available during the day."</p>

<p>Those who rely on the service include veterans, the disabled and low-income residents. Elderly residents are not affected by the system.</p>

<p>Lampe fears many clients will also be forced to change to health care providers nearer their homes.</p>

<p>Ray Blanco, a company representative in charge of setting up contracts with cab companies, would not comment to Isthmus about how LogistiCare will operate in Wisconsin, saying, "you're not a transportation company." He referred Isthmus to the corporate office, but did not know whom the paper should speak with.</p>

<p>Although the change is coming as Gov. Scott Walker tries to push through a budget with drastic cuts to human services, he did not initiate this change — former Gov. Jim Doyle did.</p>

<p>"It's a horrible move on the part of the Wisconsin Department of Health Services," says Carl DuRocher, an advocate for public transportation. "It's further disappointing that we can't even blame it on Walker this time."</p>
