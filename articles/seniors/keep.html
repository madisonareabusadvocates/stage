<h2>Help seniors keep the keys</h2>

SENIOR citizens don't want to hear that their driving should be limited in the interest of public safety. They rightly note that there are good and bad drivers in every age group. But the aging process is real, and has its effects. Still, there are ideas worthy of exploration that can help older drivers. One suggestion may be for seniors to rethink the routes they take. Another worth considering is for departments of transportation to revisit how intersections are designed.
<p>
Something needs to be done, and soon. As tough as today's older population is, we are just seeing the tip of the iceberg. Some 70 million Baby Boomers are moving toward senior status - the oldest are now 61 - and you can expect the largest generation in history to put up massive resistance to losing their wheels.
<p>
And most of them shouldn't have to. Research conducted by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety suggests that taking the keys from seniors doesn't have to be the only way to ensure their safety on the nation's roads. They may merely need to adjust their habits. For example, the insurance institute's findings make it clear that it may be better for seniors to drive the expressway instead of surface streets.
<p>
Intersections are a big danger for senior drivers. In its survey, the institute found that 40 percent of the fatal collisions involving drivers age 70 and older occurred at intersections. That's nearly twice the intersection fatality rate for the 35 to 54 age group. In fact, a solid majority of all the drivers who had crashes at intersections were at least 80 years of age.
<p>
Most of those accidents were blamed on the seniors' failure to yield. Obviously, older drivers should be encouraged to avoid high-traffic intersections, and those who can cope with higher speeds should be urged to take the expressway. But it wouldn't hurt to improve intersection designs. Clearly lit green-light arrows telling motorists when to turn left is one good idea. Replacing signaled intersections with traffic circles is another.
<p>
Driving gives motorists independence, and as we age, we tend to have less of it, and take pride in clinging to what we have. Nobody wants to give up driving, although older drivers must recognize that they have depth-perception and age-related vision problems, their reflexes are not as sharp, and their ability to process information slows.
<p>
That doesn't mean many seniors can't make adjustments and cope. It means we have to work harder to avoid having people of every age die on the roads.
