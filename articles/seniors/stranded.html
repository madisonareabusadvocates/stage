   <h1 align=center>Americans: Stranded Without Options<br>

The
demographics of the United States will change dramatically during the next 25
years as more baby boomers reach their 60s, 70s and beyond. The U.S. Census
Bureau projects that the number of Americans age 65 or older will swell from 35
million today to more than 62 million by 2025<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>-<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>nearly an 80 percent
increase. As people grow older, they often become less willing or able to drive,
making it necessary to depend on alternative methods of transportation.</font></span></p>

<p>
Unfortunately,
the United States is currently ill prepared to provide adequate transportation
choices for our rapidly aging population. Alternatives to driving are sparse,
particularly in some regions and in rural and small town communities. As the
number of older people increases, so too will their mobility needs. How the
nation addresses this issue will have significant social and economic
ramifications.
<p>
This
report presents new findings based on the National Household Transportation
Survey of 2001 and places them in the context of other research on mobility in
the aging population.
<p>
More
than one in five (21%) Americans age 65 and older do not drive.  Some reasons include:
<ul>
  <li>Declining health, eyesight, physical or mental abilities;</li>
  <li><p>Concern over safety (self-regulation);</li>

  <li><p> No car or no access to a car;</li>
  <li><p> Personal preference.</li>
