<h2>Madison may require homeowners to clear bus stops to aid disabled riders </h2>

For people who use wheelchairs, piles of snow at the bus stop aren't just hills to climb but barriers that keep them from work, school or the grocery store.
<p>
"That snow accumulation becomes an impediment to having a life," said Lynn Breedlove, executive director of Disability Rights Wisconsin.
<p>
But who should clear the snow?
<p>
A proposed change to a city ordinance that would shift responsibility from the city to homeowners was scheduled for consideration by the Madison City Council on Tuesday night.
<p>
The proposal, sponsored by Ald. Chris Schmidt, would mean 200 to 300 property owners whose sidewalk abuts a wheelchair-accessible bus stop would have to clear the patch of concrete between the sidewalk and the stop or face a fine of $177.
<p>
Critics of the change were not hard to find.
<p>
"This would shift the burden to the property owner and I feel it's the city's responsibility," said Scott Vaughn, a citizen member of the public works committee who voted no in a 3-2 committee vote. "I don't think we should rely on property owners who may themselves be under some physical restrictions."
<p>
Breedlove said he recognized the added burden on property owners but asked that people consider what's at stake.
<p>
"I feel it's all under the heading of ‘Let's all share some of the burden to make this a good place to live,' " he said.
<p>
The proposal, which Schmidt drafted with the city attorney's office after what he called years of complaints by bus riders with disabilities, was first introduced to the City Council in early August and has been under review in committees since. Schmidt said public comments disapproving the measure intensified in the last day or two.
<p>
"I was not laboring under the delusion that this would be welcomed with open arms," he said. "This particular solution is not my first choice" in dealing with the problem.
<p>
He and Vaughn said the best solution would be to leave the job in the hands of the city Streets department. But figures show the department significantly over budget this fiscal year in snow removal from bus stops, and Schmidt said streets crews can't always get to bus stops amid their street clearing duties. Officials estimate the change would save the city between $9,000 and $18,000 a winter.
<p>
Even some people with disabilities who ride the bus said that, despite the cost savings, it wouldn't be an effective solution.
<p>
"It's not going to solve anything," said Lorry Bond, 51, who's been riding the bus for nearly two decades. "It's just adding one more burden on to homeowners."
<p>
Schmidt recommended the council refer the issue back to a subcommittee that deals with access to transit for people with disabilities.
<p>
"I think it would be good for the (subcommittee) to weigh in on it one more time now that we've got more public feedback," he said.
