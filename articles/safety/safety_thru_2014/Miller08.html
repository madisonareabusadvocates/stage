<h2>MillerCoors offering free Metro bus rides on New Year's Eve</h2>
<h4><strong>The Capital Times<br/>
December 28<br/>
2008</strong></h4>

<p>MillerCoors is partnering with Metro Transit to offer the a free rides program in the Madison area on New Year's Eve.</p>
<p>This will be the program's 15th year of free rides for Madison area residents. Encouraging people to celebrate New Year's responsibly, the program helps prevent drunken driving by providing a safe transportation alternative.</p>
<p>MillerCoors Free Rides will offer free bus service starting at 7 p.m. on Wednesday on Metro Transit routes with service to Madison, town of Madison, Middleton and Fitchburg.</p>
<p>"The MillerCoors Free Rides program reminds consumers that drunk driving is completely preventable, and is just one of the options available to ensure that those celebrating the holiday get home safely," said Kim Marotta, vice president of corporate social responsibility for MillerCoors, said in a release.</p>
<p>"Whether people take the bus, use a designated driver, call a cab or decide to stay overnight at a hotel or friend's home, planning ahead helps make the evening memorable for all the right reasons," she said in a press release.</p>
<p>MillerCoors Free Rides has successfully helped prevent drunken driving throughout its history by taking more than 1.7 million cars off the road during key holidays, the release said.</p>
<p>The program recently received recognition from the Wisconsin chapter of Mothers Against Drunk Driving (MADD), which presented MillerCoors with an award for the community service program at its first annual statewide award ceremony in September.</p>
<p>The program will provide service to many popular holiday destinations, including restaurants, bars, local family events and neighborhood celebrations.</p>
<p>Route and schedule information is available at www.MillerCoorsFreeRides.com or by calling 1-800-FREE-RIDES (1-800-373-3743).</p>
<p>"This important community event helps to keep New Year's Eve safe for everyone," said Chuck Kamp, general manager of Metro Transit. "The MillerCoors Free Rides program makes it easy and fun for people to use Metro and to safely ring in the New Year."</p>
<p>"Alternative transportation programs like MillerCoors Free Rides are wonderful for helping to keep our roads safe," said Jim Cardinal, executive director of the Wisconsin Sheriffs &amp; Deputy Sheriff's Association. "Be smart and designate a driver or choose another way to get home safely this holiday and please don't forget to buckle up."</p>
<p>MillerCoors is the second largest beer company in America, capturing nearly 30 percent of U.S. beer sales.</p>
