<h3>Bus Cameras Making a Comeback In Response to Rider Safety Fears</h3>
<strong></strong><br/>

<p>
Maybe this time it will work. Earlier this year Madison's Common Council authorized a resolution to put cameras in 15 city buses. This was in response to reports of unruly behavior and violence on some bus routes. In at least one case, a driver was attacked by a passenger. There will be four cameras in each of the 15 buses. The buses equipped with cameras will be rotated on various routes as needs are identified by drivers and by passengers.
<p>
This is not the first time the focus is on cameras as a solution to bad behavior on and around buses. About 15 years ago cameras were installed on eight city buses. At that time attention was on school buses. Middle and high school students were required to show a student ID in order to qualify for the student bus rate. Putting in cameras was an attempt to prevent non-students from riding school bus routes and causing trouble.
<p>
Those eight cameras gradually died as electrical things do. They could not be repaired; parts could not be obtained. A request to replace them was quashed because of surveillance concerns prevalent in the city at that time. The Alcohol License and Review Committee had moved that surveillance cameras be installed in bars. This provoked a predictable outcry that extended to distrust of cameras on buses.
<p>
Metro is seeking another use of cameras as well. The city's Parking and Transportation Committee approved cameras for the South Transfer Point. Metro is exploring prices. At this time, cameras are planned only at the South Transfer Point but if the price is low enough, a request will be made to install cameras at the West Transfer Point as well.
<p>
Ann Gullickson, Metro's Transit Services Manager, says that cameras are only one tool in an overall security plan. Before seeking approval from the City Council, Metro surveyed other cities. In Wisconsin the cities of Appleton, Merrill, Milwaukee and Waukesha all use cameras on buses. In many cases they are used for insurance purposes as much as for security. If someone slips or falls on a bus the camera footage provides additional information.
<p>
The cameras being considered record up to 30 hours of footage. This is about two days of regular bus service or about a week of school bus service. This allows time for a driver or a passenger to alert Metro to an incident that may have happened on a particular bus. In addition, a driver can bookmark an incident at the time it is being recorded. When that happens the hard drive is unloaded from the camera and a copy of the time in question is made. The copy becomes subject to the city's Open Records law and will be retained for 120 days.
<p>
Complaints from riders and drivers prompted Metro to look into the use of cameras. Madison Area Bus Advocates wants the bus to be an efficient, clean, convenient and affordable mode of transportation. Member Susan De Vos said the organization has not specifically talked about cameras on buses. But if cameras make riding the bus more convenient to riders who might otherwise be intimidated, harassed or hurt, she suspected the organization would support having them. And since transfer points are simple extensions of buses, cameras at the South and West Transfer Points would seem, she said.
<p>
De Vos added that it would seem that there is some evidence that having cameras would reduce violence at transfer points and on buses although some people doubt that having cameras would be as effective as desired.
<p>
Mike Hanson, Public Information Officer for the Madison Police Department, was out of the office but Carlos Valentin, his substitute, said that the Police Department regards surveillance cameras as useful not only as evidence but also as a deterrent. He stressed that the Police Department is not taking the lead on this; it is Madison Metro's project but the Police Department is supportive. He was not aware of any other surveillance cameras at other places in the city. The Police Department is aware of the bus schedule at the South Transfer Point and has assigned patrol cars to monitor it.
<p>
A proven value of cameras is in identifying perpetrators and prosecuting them. Lieutenant Karen Soley of the UW-Madison Police said that whenever there is a break-in or other crime committed at UW buildings, the police ask about cameras. Any cameras in campus buildings are installed at the initiative of the department that owns the building. Most locations do not have them but when they do, the cameras are frequently tied to an alarm system and activated only when a break-in occurs.
<p>
The Dane County Airport has several cameras and they are monitored. Many of these were installed to comply with federal security regulations. Sharyn Wisniewski, spokeswoman for the airport, said that the video has been pulled from these cameras when an incident has occurred. Like the Metro cameras, these are useful for insurance purposes as well as crime deterrence and/or prosecution.
<p>
What Metro is installing are not really surveillance cameras since they will not be monitored. Metro does not have the budget to fund staff time to monitor cameras. Even so, ongoing maintenance and eventual replacement of cameras will cut into Metro's budget.
<p>
Cameras may deter crime. There is little hard evidence of this. Cameras definitely can help convict those caught in a crime. Susan De Vos commented there sometimes is a delicate balance between privacy and sanctioning against poor behavior. Those complaining about the possibility of cameras in bars several years ago opted for one side of the balance against cameras. Those troubled, annoyed and threatened by bad behavior on buses are opting for the other side.
