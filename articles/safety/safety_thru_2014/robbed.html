<h2>Two teens robbed at gunpoint; cops stop bus to arrest four</h2>
<h4><strong>BILL NOVAK The Capital Times December 23<br/>
2009</strong></h4>

<p>Four suspects have been arrested by Madison police in connection with the alleged armed robbery of two teens on the city's far west side Tuesday afternoon.</p>
<p>The robbery happened at about 1:45 p.m. Tuesday in the 7400 block of Mineral Point Road.</p>
<p>The four suspects, 15 to 20 years old, were arrested while riding on a Metro bus at the corner of Mineral Point and Gammon roads.</p>
<p>The suspects got on the bus shortly after the alleged robbery took place, said police spokesman Joel DeSpain.</p>
<p>"The crime took place outside, and one of the four suspects had a handgun," DeSpain said.</p>
<p>"One of the victims was struck during the robbery but didn't ask for medical care," DeSpain said.</p>
<p>The victims gave good descriptions of the suspects and what direction they headed.</p>
<p>"Armed with this knowledge, a Madison police officer determined the crooks had likely boarded a Metro bus," DeSpain said.</p>
<p>The bus was stopped by police, and the four suspects were on the bus, police said.</p>
<p>"Money and electronic items were taken during the robbery, and one suspect was found carrying at least one stolen item," DeSpain said. "Officers also recovered a facsimile handgun."</p>
