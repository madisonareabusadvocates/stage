<h2>Laptop City Hall: How can Madison Metro transfer point security be improved?</h2>
<h4><strong>By Kristin Czubkowski The Capital Times March 31<br/>
2009</strong></h4>

<p>I feel like I see a story [like this] every week about something breaking out at a Madison Metro transfer point, and interestingly (to me at least), it is almost without fail a different transfer point in question each time.</p>
<p>During the budget process and bus fare saga, the safety of transfer points was brought up as a primary issue that needed to be addressed, and one of the justifications for the fare increase was paying for $75,000 in security services for the transfer points. However, during the debates, Ald. Satya Rhodes-Conway brought up a point that I find myself referring back to often -- if the transfer points were not so isolated, would they be as prone to crime? I live near the South Transfer Point, and I wouldn't say it was totally isolated per se, but it's not close to that many things --a McDonald's is just north of it and the Villager Mall not too much farther, and there is a state building and I believe a fire department building nearby. Still, I think it's safe to say there is not a ton going on in the area, and I'm curious if what Satya said might be true. If transfer points were more mixed-use or located in more densely developed areas and there was more going on at all points in the day, do you guys think that would improve their safety?</p>
<p>Also, if the buildings were more mixed-use, I wonder what they could be mixed with. Almost everything seems like it would be compatible with being close to public transit and/or a transfer point, but if there's a stigma about the security of those points, would it be difficult to get businesses to locate there if the city decided to pursue mixed-use at the points?</p>
<p>If you don't think mixed-use development would improve transfer point safety, what do you think would? Or, perhaps I should ask, do you think transfer point safety needs to be improved? Do you think the additional security will help, and if so, do you think it will help at all transfer points? In particular, I know the South Transfer Point is perhaps two blocks from the South District police station, while the West Transfer Point is about three miles away from the West District police station. Does that make a difference in whether additional security will be a benefit?</p>
<p>If it's not abundantly obvious, I don't really have any answers to these questions, but it is kind of interesting how much a short police brief can make you think about things.</p>
