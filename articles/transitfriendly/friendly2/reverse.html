<h2>Parks vows he'd reverse bus shifts</h2>
<h4><strong>by Aaron Nathans<br/>
The Capital Times, March 12, 1999</strong></h4>

<p>if elected he would scrap the new bus hub system and "go back to what we had" before the July route restructuring. The new bus system is "driving people back to their automobiles. It's complex," Parks said. "People don't want to get on the bus, get to a bus hub and wait. . . . The system that we had was working."</p>
<p>Metro overhauled its routes last year, switching from a downtown-based system to four transfer stations throughout the city. The new stations cost $5 million.</p>
<p>The change has helped some, providing service to previously uncovered areas. But many have complained the new schedules are confusing, and some say the switch makes their commutes longer.</p>
<p>Metro general manager Paul Larrousse said he did not wish to comment. His boss, Mayor Sue Bauman, could not be reached for comment.</p>
<p>Parks said he would sell off the land on which the new transfer points sit. And he said people are going to have to support public transportation more. He said he would put Madisonians on notice that if ridership doesn't increase in two years, he'd make service cuts to save money.</p>
<p>Ridership took a 2 percent dip in 1998. Metro officials said they expected a slight decrease during the year the new system went into place.</p>
<p>Parks introduced the proposal in a telephone interview Thursday after meeting with a group of about 20 fourth- and fifth-graders at Lincoln Elementary School on the 'city's south side. He  stressed to the children that he rides the bus and would continue to do so as mayor.</p>
<p>Parks said he would expect department heads to ride the bus, too, to show "leadership by example."</p>
<p>He also pointed to the April 6 election as an opportunity to choose between Madison's first woman mayor and the first black candidate to make it to the general election.</p>
<p>"I'm an incentive for you," Parks said, getting passionate but restraining his voice from his trademark roar. "You can do what you want if you work hard enough for it."</p>
<p>Teacher Jeff Maas' class has a tradition of interviewing School Board members and making endorsements. But with two uncontested School Board races this year, his class also dipped into the mayoral election. The students will interview Mayor Sue Bauman later this month and decide whether to endorse a candidate.</p>
<p>Parks told the story of Ed Coleman, a 103-year-old South Carolina man who walked two and a half miles from his home to a polling place to cast his vote in a 1979 special election. Parks stressed that voting is a responsibility and a privilege.</p>
<p>Answering a question about drug policy, Parks told the students the city is doing what it can to fight drugs with the personal issue that goes beyond government. "Drugs will destroy your life and the lives of the people around you," Parks said. "As you grow older some of you will be  tempted. There will be those of you who think you can make easy, fast money selling drugs to your friends."</p>
<p>The students asked Parks some probing, topical questions, such as his views on discrimination, environmental protection and urban sprawl.</p>
<p>He responded to the sprawl question by saying that Madison has used up much of its available space, and that a higher population means more services are necessary. That, in turn, costs the
city more money.</p>
<p>He segued from there into talk about a different, sort, of sprawl  the Internet and how it has made neighbors of everyone around the world.</p>
<p>Answers like that gave some of the students mixed impressions of Parks. Shanna Dell, 11, said she didn't think Parks answered all of their questions directly. "But he took our interview seriously," she said. Some previous visitors seeking endorsements have failed to do that, she said.</p>
<p>Cecilia Kress, 10, said she found Parks "very inspiring. I think he really wanted us to go on into the future" as adults in a computer age.</p>
<p>For his part, Parks was impressed with the questions and how the students did their homework on the election issues. "I didn't get anything like this at the Rotary Club," Parks said. "There were adult reporters there who didn't even get close to this."</p>
