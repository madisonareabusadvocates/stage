<h2>Wheels on Metro buses keep going round</h2>
<p>Wheels on Metro buses keep going round
The Badger Herald
January 25, 2007
By Heather Quitos</p>

<p>In an urban environment congested with more high-rise buildings than parking spots, Madison Metros ridership is approaching record levels not reached in 20 years.</p>

<p>With more than 12 million rides in 2006, the city bus systems ridership is continually rising, according to Mayor Dave Cieslewicz.</p>

<p>But Metro has received both praise and criticism from citizens about the transit systems efficiency.</p>

<p>Cieslewicz, in an effort to improve the system, created the Long Range Metro Transit Planning Ad Hoc Committee, which will evaluate and analyze the citys bus system over the course of one year.</p>

<p>I think weve proved in the last four years that my administration is committed to (a) strong bus system, he said, calling Madison Metro a very healthy system. Thats why I appointed a committee  to look into the future of Metro and really try to take it regional.</p>

<p>According to committee member Carl Durocher, who is also chair of the citys Transit and Parking Commission, the transit group will advise Cieslewiczs administration and respective committees on various issues concerning the system.</p>

<p>The ad hoc committee is different than other groups looking to improve transportation, Durocher said, because some of the members come from businesses  a field not normally involved in the committee process.</p>

<p>Evaluating Madison Metro could include tackling issues such as resources, tax levies, ridership fares, route frequency and possible route expansion, Durocher said, as the committee held its first meeting Monday.</p>

<p>Cieslewiczs efforts to strengthen the transit system were applauded in a report released last week by the Wisconsin Department of Transportation. The report showed Madison buses rank among the top transit systems in comparison to cities similar in size.</p>

<p>The DOT report  based on 2003 data  compared the transit system with similar systems in 11 cities: Indianapolis, Ind.; Omaha, Neb.; Syracuse, N.Y.; Dayton, Ohio; Toledo, Ohio; Albany, N.Y.; Rochester, N.Y.; Hartford, Conn.; Providence, R.I.; Spokane, Wash.; and Tacoma, Wash.</p>

<p>According to the report, Madison Metro averages 30.7 passengers each hour they run, which is higher than the collective average of 24.62.</p>

<p>Additionally, the systems cost is $2.77 per ride, lower than the $3.45 average.</p>

<p>While Cieslewicz said the report is an indication of the work he has put into building a strong Metro system for the city, Durocher said he is also aware of current complaints coming from Madison residents about transportation.</p>

<p>Madison Metro General Manager Chuck Kamp, who took over in late 2006, said the community should be proud of its system after looking at the current numbers.</p>

<p>I am not suggesting that there [arent] any flaws, Kamp said. There are areas that we need to work on, but to chart [service] as inefficient is inaccurate.</p>

<p>Durocher said one public perception among residents he hopes the committee will work to change is the idea that buses are a last resort for transportation.</p>

<p>For reasons I dont understand, there are people that dont ride buses because some of them think that theyre above riding buses, Durocher said. Weve got to change this perception around to where people think riding a bus is a privilege;  its actually one of the benefits of living in the city.</p>

<p>Total expenses for running the Metro system per hour are $85.02, about three dollars more expensive than the other cities average of $82.79  a figure Kamp said transit personnel are working to lower.</p>

<p>But overall, Kamp said the numbers show a very efficient system, but one that he will work to improve as the new general manager.</p>

<p>You have to look at all these numbers together. There, I think we get a very strong grade, Kamp said. When I hear Metro is inefficient, it sounds like were getting a D, but this report says were getting a B+. Were looking at ways to get into the A- and A+ area.</p>

<p>Cieslewicz added that city support for Madison Metro has increased 35 percent in the past four years.</p>

<p>The overall support from the community creates enough momentum for the committee to make strides in improving Madisons public transportation system, Durocher said.</p>

<p>We have a city that supports the goals of transportation. Since weve got all of that going for us, its an upward spiral, Durocher said. But we cant in any way rest on that faith, and we have to continually press upward on that spiral. I think were doing really well, but I think theres more room for improvement.</p>
