<h2>State sees promise in new bus hub plan</h2>
<h4><strong>by Joe Schoenmann<br/>
The Capital Times, August 10, 1990</strong></h4>

<p>A city bus hub near the Hill Farms state offices might not be such a bad idea after all, a state 
official said today.</p>
<p>James Klauser, secretary of the Department of Administration, said this morning a new proposal by the city "is better conceived" than one he rejected a year ago.</p>
<p>"There are some good things in the proposal," he said. Important to the state is accessibility to Hill Farms State Office Building at 4802 Sheboygan Ave., on Madison's near west side. The place isn't all that easy to find right now, Klauser suggested.</p>
<p>As it stands now, he said, "when people come from out of state looking for our office, they have to bounce all over the place" to find it.</p>
<p>Mayor Paul Soglin's new bus hub idea, he noted, will help get rid of that problem.</p>
<p>"This bus hub might make it easier for people to get from downtown to our complex on the
west side," Klauser suggested. "This may make it much more convenient because we'll have a good convenient bus service, and we'd be willing to consider interconnecting — having access to 
the complex, coming off the ramp."</p>
<p>He added: "We could do something to facilitate entrance into the (office) building from the basement  there are a lot of possibilities."</p>
<p>The bus hub plan is expected to bolster the city's sagging bus service by making it more efficient. Some 400 buses would use the bus hub at Hill Farms each day.</p>
<p>The prospect of the resulting traffic and noise essentially sunk proposals for the hub in other 
parts of the city, as citizens came out in droves against the idea.</p>
<p>Klauser said his main concern is "that we don't disrupt our complex out there and we continue to provide parking and don't spend any more of the state taxpayers' money.</p>
