<h2>Are Banks a Roadblock to Walkable Development?</h2>
<h4><strong>By By Derek P. Jensen djensen@sltrib.com<br/>
The Salt Lake Tribune, October 14, 2009</strong></h4>

<p>UTAH - Salt Lake City's new-urbanism epiphany -- fervently backed by Mayor Ralph Becker and the City Council -- appears to be catching static from an unlikely source.</p>
<p>Transit-oriented development isn't stymied by outdated zoning, unwilling developers or a lack of space. It turns out, banks, wedded to old-fashioned lending standards that stress parking, may pose the biggest blockade by denying financing.</p>
<p>The reason: Lenders operate from a tried-and-true principle that maintains more parking means less risk and a higher return on their investment. But ditching cars is the whole point of urban developers looking to create 24-hour live, work and play environments that hug light-rail hubs.</p>
<p>Take the capital's gateway district, which soon could be further revived by a North Temple TRAX train, a new viaduct and millions in streetscape upgrades. City leaders envision a walkable, vibrant mix of housing, retail, restaurants and offices that one day will bridge the FrontRunner hub and a new North Temple transit station along downtown's western rim.</p>
<p>But commercial investors, including one with a $100 million blueprint, complain banks cannot grasp the concept and instead slam their doors.</p>
<p>"It's an interesting dilemma," says Council Chairman Carlton Christensen. "In Portland [Ore.] they admitted it and said it took a number of years. For the first few projects, lenders had to have their hands held. The educational part is critical. We can help facilitate that."</p>
<p>To be sure, commercial loans in general are incredibly difficult to secure as the Great Recession drags on. But more and more mixed-use builders cannot get banks to finance their projects without a guaranteed number of parking stalls, Redevelopment Agency Executive Director D.J. Baxter recently told the council.</p>
<p>As he unveiled the conundrum, developers Jeff Woodbury with Woodbury Corp., Russ Callister with Mecham Investments, and Tom Guinney with Gastronomy nodded in the background. The builders later said a recent tour of Portland, set up by the city, convinced them that a largely car-less combo of live-work-and-recreate projects could thrive.</p>
<p>But banks, which often sell the loans after a few years, need to ensure whatever is financed is acceptable to the long-term credit market. That way, they don't end up with foreclosures they must unload.</p>
<p>"We're not going to make a loan without getting comfortable with the parking element and the parking strategy," explains Michael Morris, executive vice president of real estate for Zions Bank.</p>
<p>Other factors besides parking ratios also play a role, he says, including the overall economy and the mix of equity and debt.</p>
<p>Construction lenders could be "flexible" and approve transit-oriented projects, Morris says, so long as long-term lenders are content. But he predicts parking at housing units, regardless of location, likely will remain a premium.</p>
<p>"I don't know if public transportation or fuel efficiency or the green movement is going to change that in the near term," Morris adds, before pausing. "As a corporation, we're open-minded and will participate in the dialogue. And we'll do what makes sense."</p>
<p>Former Salt Lake City Planning Director Stephen Goldsmith says parking was a frequent fight while shepherding the "progressive planning" for Artspace under then-Mayor Rocky Anderson. Unfortunately, he argues, the outdated thinking remains.</p>
<p>"The lack of alignment that exists in the banking community and the city offices to accomplish community goals," Goldsmith says, "is quite astounding."</p>
<p>Still, the perception problem may not rest solely with the banks, says Councilman Luke Garrott, a Chicago native and transit advocate.</p>
<p>"It's with the perception of potential tenants and buyers," Garrott says. "We still want it both ways in Salt Lake. We're still a car culture."</p>
<p>Andrew Adamson, a Barnes Bank manager in Salt Lake City, agrees.</p>
<p>"Utah hasn't graduated yet to that phase of what the city wants to do," he says, adding that large regional banks get more restrictive after getting burned. "Mixed-use stuff has an element of risk. If there's not a market for that product, maybe they're saying, 'We won't do a loan for that.' "</p>
<p>Bruce Bingham, whose Hamilton Partners is about to complete the new 222 S. Main office tower, sees it differently. He deliberately scaled back parking -- the skyscraper offers two slots per 1,000 feet of rental space -- because of the proximity to light rail.</p>
<p>"So far, it's proven out that the TRAX stop is going to compensate for a lack of excess parking," he says. "The same conditions would exist for any transit-oriented development near a TRAX stop."</p>
<p>Bingham also disputes the notion that all downtown development must include surface lots or parking garages. Nearly 5,000 parking spaces, he points out, sit within a block and a half of 300 South and State Street.</p>
<p>"The myth that there is a lack of parking in Salt Lake is just that: a myth."</p>
<p>Perhaps the only market force fueling transit-oriented projects is the high price of adding parking.</p>
<p>Right now, The Gateway mall still wrestles with the balance. If the city successfully raises the $71 million for a new North Temple viaduct, the base of the bridge will wipe out 200 Gateway parking stalls that mall owners may want back.</p>
<p>"Will we have to build them a parking garage?" an incredulous Garrott asked the RDA staff.</p>
<p>The Gateway is not yet sure it needs the spaces to support its long-term growth, Baxter notes, although some city leaders fear it will insist.</p>
<p>But, like the lenders who got new-urbanist religion in Portland, Christensen and Co. predict a similar conversion could happen here.</p>
