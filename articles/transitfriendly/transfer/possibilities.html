<h2>Officials study other west hub sites</h2>
<h4>The Capital Times, July 23, 1990<br>
          by Mike Ivey</h4>

<p>
Furious neighborhood opposition to a transit center at Vernon Boulevard &#0151; culminating in a lawsuit against the city &#0151; has led Madison officials to consider moving the bus hub to an alternate west-side site near the Hill Farms State Office Building.
<p>
In a news conference today, Mayor Paul Soglin was expected to say the city is negotiating with the state. The state originally had opposed a bus hub at Hill Farms but may reconsider.
<p>
The city is looking at four alternatives: two in the Hill Farms parking lot and two off University Avenue behind the office building, a source told The Capital Times. The city would agree to replace from 125 to 200 parking spaces in the Hill Farms lot by building a parking ramp or incorporating parking with an underground bus hub.
<p>
"All along we've been entertaining other options," said Madison Metro General Manager Paul Larrousse. "This is just another option. We'll take a look and see what it will cost."
<p>
City officials estimate the cost for the bus hub plan has increased while siting negotiations drag on. A federal grant was to pay for the $2.7 million project but costs have now risen to $3.6 million, according to recent estimates.
<p>
Last Wednesday, M&I Bank of Hilldale, Anchor Savings and Loan Association, the General Partners and Jefferson Building Associates  all located on Vernon Boulevard &#0151; filed suit in Dane County CircuitCourt seeking to block a proposed bus transit center.
<p>
Residents and businesses in the neighborhood have opposed a bus hub on Vernon Boulevard since the city proposed the location last year. They have cited increased noise and pollution, and pedestrian safety and traffic problems related to the 400 buses that would use the hub each day. The site is a block south of Hilldale Shopping Center.
<p>
Metro also plans a bus hub for the east side, but that move has bogged down due to similar complaints from neighbors and businesses.
<p>
Plans originally called for the hubs to be completed by October, but that date has been moved back to next summer.
<p>
Metro is going ahead with some route changes in anticipation of the bus hubs being built next year. Those changes will go into effect in September.
<p>
Metro has been working to reorganize city bus service around two transfer hubs  one on the west side and one on the east side. Tney would anchor a hub and feeder system designed to make the bus
system more efficient and save money.
<p>
Metro officials hope a reorganized system would also attract new riders. Madison Metro has lost about a third of its riders since 1982.
