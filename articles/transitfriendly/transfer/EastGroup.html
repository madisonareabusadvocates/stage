<h2>Group formed to fight hub on east side</h2>
<h4>The Capital Times, August 9, 1990<br>
          by Mike Ivey</h4>

<p>
Opponents of a proposed city bus hub on the triangle between Winnebago Street , and East  Washington Avenue have formed a group to fight the move. 
<p>
WWHOA (Washington Winnebago Hub Opposition Alliance) says a bus hub on the triangle would destroy a newly revitalized neighborhood and endanger the health and safety of elderly people and children who live nearby.
<p>
"People are putting a lot of effort into their homes here," said WWHOA chairman Jeremiah Cahill. 
"Putting a bus hub in our neighborhood would'truly erode all the gains we've made in the past few years."
<p>
The city recently began considering a bus hub on Winnebago after plans to site a hub behind the Madison East Shopping Center were blocked by a petition of nearby residents.
<p>
Cahill said the best site for an east-side bus hub remains the front of the shopping center.
"The only reason the No. 1 site was dropped is because shopping center managers fear a loss of parking spaces. We don't think that is a sufficient reason for the City Council to drop the No. 1 choice for a site," Cahill said.
<p>
The Winnebago site is across from the Rayovac plant and employees there are also opposed to a bus hub, WWHOA says. Employees cite the loss of a union headquarters office, fears of increased 
crime and spoiling of an outdoors lunch and break area.
<p.
WWHOA members include local songwriter Peter Berryman, former Dane County Supervisor Julie Melton, attorney Howard Young and former City Council member Harold Klubertanz.
<p>
WWHOA said running 430 buses a day would threaten the safety of Emerson school and East High School students who must cross East Washington Avenue.
