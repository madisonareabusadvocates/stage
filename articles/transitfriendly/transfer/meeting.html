Madison Metro will hold the first of five public meetings on bus transfer points at 7 p.m. tonight at Midvale Lutheran Church, 4329 Tokay Blvd.
<p>
The proposed transfer points are part of a restructured route system intended to provide more flexibility for riders and to shorten transit trips to peripheral areas.
<p>
The five proposed transfer point locations are:
<p>
East — Milwaukee Street/
Corporate Drive: This site is the
former Sports Pub location running
parallel to Milwaukee Street
from Corporate Drive.
<p>
North &#0151; Aberg Avneue: This site is adjacent to Huxley Street south of Aberg Avenue on property owned by Oscar Mayer.
<p>
South &#0151; South Park Street: Several sites are under consideration.

Southwest &#0151; Research Park: This site is in the new Research Park addition west of Whitney
Way, running parallel to Tokay Boulevard.
<p>
West &#0151; Hill Farms State Transportation Building: This site is at the western edge of the visitor lot, adjacent to the Red Cross.
<p>
The transfer points will be designed to hold from six to eight buses along a center island with
bus parking along the sides. A canopy will cover the island and extend slightly over the top of the buses to protect passengers from inclement weather. Lighting and passenger information also will be provided.
<p>
Buses will arrive and depart the transfer points on a coordinated schedle for immediate transfer between buses.
<p>
The four other meetings on the transfer points will be at:
<ul>
<li>South Madison Library, 2222 S. Park, 6:30 p.m. Oct. 7.</li>
<li>Hilldale Mall conference room, 7 p.m. Oct. 21.</li>
<li>Pinney Library, 204 Cottage Grove Rd., 7 p.m. Oct. 23.</li>
<li>Sherman School, 1610 Ruskin, 7 p.m. Oct. 28.</li>
