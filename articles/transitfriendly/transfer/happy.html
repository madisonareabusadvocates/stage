Although both the public and city officials have recently questioned the wisdom of switching to a hub transfer system, Madison Metro riders remain generally satisfied with bus service, according
to a recent survey of bus riders. 
<p>
The survey, which polled riders on weekday trips, found that 81 percent of riders rated service as "good" or "very good," down slightly from a 1997 survey when 86 percent polled rated service 'as "good" or "very good."
<p>
The survey also found that most riders use the bus to commute to work and that the number of riders who have a license to drive — 75 percent — has decreased since 1985.
<p>
"This indicates that the percentage of Metro's ridership that is transit dependent is increasing," said the report's authors.
