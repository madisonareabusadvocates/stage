<h2>Zero Emission Bus Program Kick-Off Event</h2>
<h4><strong>February 25, 2005</strong></h4>

<p>San Jose, Calif. — Hydrogen power is taking a step closer to becoming a viable fuel source for the public transportation industry.</p>

<p>On Thursday, February 24, 2005, Congressman Mike Honda joined local officials from Santa Clara Valley Transportation Authority (VTA) and San Mateo County Transit District (SamTrans) to welcome the first hydrogen-powered, zero-emission fuel-cell buses (ZEBs) into service. The $18.5-million program includes the purchase and operation of three ZEBs and technological enhancements to VTA's existing Cerone Operations Division to accommodate and maintain the ZEBs.</p>

<p>"I am proud to support local projects like VTA's and SamTrans' joint effort," stated Congressman Mike Honda. "Federal funding to research environmentally advanced transportation projects, such as this ZEB program, will contribute to cleaner air and a healthier environment for everyone."</p>

<p>A ZEB is a bus that emits no harmful pollutants into the atmosphere. The ZEB's engine features a fuel-cell, an electrochemical device that converts hydrogen gas and oxygen from the air into electricity, heat and water. ZEBs are low-floor, 40-foot buses that have standard equipment, including air conditioning, ramps for disabled accessibility, destination signs, and audio annunciation systems, which are all powered by electricity generated by the fuel-cell.</p>

<p>VTA, as the lead agency in the program, contracted with Gillig Corporation of Hayward and Ballard Power Systems of Burnaby, Canada to build the vehicles. Air Products &amp; Chemicals, Inc. supplies the liquid hydrogen, which is converted to hydrogen gas at VTA's fueling station at Cerone. The partnership will yield three clean-running, low-noise buses that may prove ideal for use in congested, urban settings like Santa Clara and San Mateo Counties, where high-technology businesses draw traffic from the entire Bay Area.</p>

<p>VTA and SamTrans are working closely with the California Fuel-cell Partnership (CaFCP) and California Air Resources Board (CARB) to comply with new regulations adopted by CARB in February 2000. This new regulation is committed to reducing nitrogen oxide and particulate matter emitted by public transit buses.</p>

<p>"VTA appreciates that building an infrastructure that promotes the use of alternative fuels, like hydrogen, is an investment for our future," shared VTA Board Member and San Jose City Council Member David Cortese. "Until that infrastructure's fully in place, local projects like our joint VTA and SamTrans project can serve to prove that truly clean alternative fuel solutions are not so far from becoming a reality."</p>

<p>San Mateo County Supervisor and SamTrans Board Chairperson Jerry Hill emphasized the importance of local efforts to the future of zero-emission technology. "As with other zero-emission programs in the Bay Area and throughout California, the goal of our partnership and this program is to bring hydrogen-based, zero-emission technology closer to using an already abundant element, hydrogen, to power our industry," Supervisor Hill stated.</p>

<p>"This landmark program has the potential to reduce our industry's and our nation's reliance on fossil fuels," shared VTA Board Member and San Jose City Council Member Forrest Williams. "If successful, our efforts will help move this new technology closer to becoming commercialized and available to public transit systems across the country."</p>

<p>On an international scale, programs to test ZEB technology are currently underway in Europe, Japan, Brazil, Mexico, China, Egypt, India and Iceland. "Today, Ballard is powering 36 buses with its fuel-cell technology, working with 12 transit agencies around the world," said Michael Rosenberg, Ballard's Treasurer. "Strong momentum is building to find alternatives to the mass transit and automotive technologies we use today, and we congratulate VTA on the launch of their fuel-cell bus fleet."</p>

<p>Rosenberg continued, "Fuel-cell vehicle programs provide thousands of people worldwide with the opportunity to experience firsthand the clean, quiet and comfortable ride of zero-emission buses and cars." The Brazilian program is using lessons from the VTA/SamTrans program to develop its prototype ZEB vehicle.</p>

<p>Following the speaker's program, attendees were able to view and ride the ZEB. The event included static displays of the Toyota and Daimler Chrysler fuel-cell cars and the Air Products mobile hydrogen fueler for public viewing.</p>

<p>The VTA/SamTrans joint program includes the operation of three ZEBs in regular VTA service beginning Monday, February 28, 2005 on VTA Bus Lines 45 and 47. The Federal Transit Administration (FTA) and the U.S. Department of Energy will also participate in evaluating the program. The program is funded by 2000 Measure A Local Sales Tax, as well as contributions from local San Mateo County sales tax, the Bay Area Air Quality Management District (BAAQMD), the California Energy Commission (CEC), and the FTA.</p>

<p>The 2000 Measure A package of transit improvements was approved by Santa Clara County voters in November 2000 by a 70.3% majority. Voter approval authorized a 30-year, ý-cent sales tax to begin in 2006. The Zero-emission Bus Demonstration Program is one of the 2000 Measure A projects.</p>

<h3>About SamTrans</h3>

<p>The San Mateo County Transit District (SamTrans) provides SamTrans bus service throughout San Mateo County and into parts of San Francisco and Palo Alto. In addition, the district is the managing agency for Caltrain, the commuter rail line between San Francisco and Gilroy, and the Transportation Authority, the planning and development agency that administers sales tax revenues for transportation improvements. The district also is a partner in the BART-SFO Extension.</p>

<h3>About VTA</h3>

<p>Santa Clara Valley Transportation Authority (VTA) is an independent special district responsible for bus, light rail and paratransit operations; congestion management; specific highway improvement projects; and countywide transportation planning. As such, VTA is both an accessible transit provider and multi-modal transportation planning organization involved with transit, highways and roadways, bikeways and pedestrian facilities.</p>
