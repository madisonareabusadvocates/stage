<h3>Metro Working On Plan For Cameras On Buses</h3>
<strong></strong><br/>
<br/>
<em>Wed. Aug. 10, 2005
By Lee Sensenbrenner The Capital Times</em>
<p>Madison Metro will continue to develop a plan to put cameras on its buses and around its transfer points in response to concerns of unruly, threatening or dangerous behavior.
<p>
The digital video cameras would also watch the drivers, Metro General Manager Catherine Debo told the Parking and Transit Commission Tuesday evening.
<p>
Although the commission voted unanimously to continue developing a plan to use surveillance, the project does not yet have firm figures on costs, and it would require additional approvals to go forward.
<p>
Debo said that the "drivers are very supportive" of the cameras, adding that they have "more to gain than to lose" with recorded footage of their workplace.
<p>
In addition to mounting cameras within buses, several cameras would watch the South Transfer Point, where students last spring allegedly attacked another young rider.
<p>
Debo said that the signal from the cameras would not likely be actively monitored, but would serve as a deterrent and create a record for investigations.
<p>
Most of the commission members said they saw some promise in a surveillance system. Member Kevin Hoag recalled riding Metro buses mounted with cameras in the past.
<p>
"It does change the behavior of the riders," he said. "I always felt safe as a rider when there was a camera."
<p>
Ald. Ken Golden, though, said that in reaction to safety concerns, "the emphasis on cameras was a little overdone."
<p>
He said he was not "morally opposed" to the idea, but questioned its cost and effectiveness.</p>
