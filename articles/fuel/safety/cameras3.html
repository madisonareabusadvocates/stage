<h3>Bus Drivers Anxious For Security Cameras</h3>
<br/>
<em>By Angela Bettis,<br/>

Nov. 15, 2005</em>
<p>MADISON, Wis. -- After an incident Tuesday morning where a middle school student shot classmates with a bb gun on a Madison Metro bus, some bus drivers are again questioning their own safety and security.
<p>
Security cameras have been approved and ordered for 15 Metro busses.
<p>
But some drivers say it will take more than just security tape for the busses to be a safe place.
<p>
Driver, Sharon Williams, said adults cause some of the violence, but most, like Tuesday's incident, involve students.
<p>
"I'm hoping that it doesn't happen to one of the drivers or another passenger," said Williams.
<p>
Williams has been driving a metro bus for seven years.
<p>
She said there are other reports of guns on busses and assaults.
<p>
"A fight ensued last week on the 18 route again and that driver is out with a dislocated shoulder," she said. "It's getting very bad so we need something to be done now."
<p>
The 15 busses slated to get security equipment will have three to four cameras recording the front, middle and rear of the bus.
<p>
The video will be monitored at a central location.
<p>
Williams believes catching culprits on tape and suspending them from bus service will stop the violence.
<p>
"We can identify some of the problem students and get them off, even if it's for a small period," she said. "That will teach them a lesson because warnings aren't working. We've already done the warning thing for years now."
<p>
Bus driver Becky Vanderaa believes it will take more than cameras to make a difference on the busses.
<p>
"I think cameras will help identify the perp(etrator) but not solve the problem," she said.
<p>
"There needs to be a time when they educate each driver on how to deal with certain situations and I think the police department could help and our management at Madison Metro could help with that," said Vanderaa.
<p>
A metro spokesperson said driver involved with the BB gun incident did not report it right away like he was supposed to.
<p>
That driver will meet with management Wednesday to detail what he witnessed.
<p>
The metro bus cameras are expected within the next few months.
