<h2>Admit transfer points were a mistake</h2>

The latest installment of Metro Transit woes has been fueled by our oil problems, something that was not foreseen years ago when, after many attempts to railroad it through, the transfer point option succeeded.
<p>
I suggest that more installments such as this -- rates vs. cuts and so on -- will continue to happen.
<p>
The only way to stop this madness is to admit that the decision to create bus transfer points was a mistake and to go back to what was then a system admired all over the world.
<p>
Among many other benefits, this would eliminate the need to deal with crime at the transfer points and allow for increased service, albeit perhaps fewer route options.
<p>
Why can't we just say the experiment failed?
