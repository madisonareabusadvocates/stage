Four suspects have been arrested by Madison police in connection with the alleged armed robbery of two teens on the city's far west side Tuesday afternoon.
<p>
The robbery happened at about 1:45 p.m. Tuesday in the 7400 block of Mineral Point Road.
<p>
The four suspects, 15 to 20 years old, were arrested while riding on a Metro bus at the corner of Mineral Point and Gammon roads.
<p>
The suspects got on the bus shortly after the alleged robbery took place, said police spokesman Joel DeSpain.
<p>
"The crime took place outside, and one of the four suspects had a handgun," DeSpain said.
<p>
The two victims are 14- and 17-year-old males.
<p>
"One of the victims was struck during the robbery but didn't ask for medical care," DeSpain said.
<p>
The victims gave good descriptions of the suspects and what direction they headed.
<p>
"Armed with this knowledge, a Madison police officer determined the crooks had likely boarded a Metro bus," DeSpain said.
<p>
The bus was stopped by police, and the four suspects were on the bus, police said.
<p>
"Money and electronic items were taken during the robbery, and one suspect was found carrying at least one stolen item," DeSpain said. "Officers also recovered a facsimile handgun."
