A 15-year-old Madison boy was allegedly beaten up by five or six other teens Friday at the Metro transfer station on Tokay Boulevard on the west side.
<p>
The incident happened about 5 p.m. at the transfer point at 5602 Tokay Blvd.
<p>
Madison police said the victim got off a bus at the transfer station and noticed five or six teens at the far end of the shelter. The teens allegedly attacked him, striking him in the head and neck.
<p>
"They didn't try to rob him," said police spokesman Joel DeSpain. "They ran off when one of the attackers said, 'Let's get out of here.'"
<p>
The victim suffered abrasions to his face and chin, caused when he hit the ground. He also had bumps on his back.<br>
