Two Fitchburg teens are in hot water after reportedly fighting with a 53-year-old Madison woman on a Metro bus.
<p>
Police said the fight started when the woman tried to take photos of the teens so she could report them for being unruly. When found and arrested after the incident, the two teens were also reportedly found to be carrying a knife and hammer.
<p>
Tyrea Louise Cherry, 17, was tentatively charged with battery, disorderly conduct and carrying a concealed weapon, and Rosalind Marie Harrison, 17, was tentatively charged with disorderly conduct and carrying a concealed weapon following the incident on the bus about 1 p.m. Tuesday in the 400 block of State Street.
<p>
The woman suffered a small cut to her finger during the fight.
<p>
According to police, the victim and teens were sitting near the back of the nearly full bus when a man using a cane came on the bus.
<p>
"She called out for someone to relinquish an upfront seat for the gentleman," said police spokesman Joel DeSpain. "The teens sitting behind her told her to mind her own business, calling her a b----, while she referred to them as brats."
<p>
The victim then took out a camera so she could photograph the teens, with one struggling with the victim for the camera, he said.
<p>
"After doing so the teen threw the camera on the floor," DeSpain said.
<p>
The bus driver pulled over, and the teens got off the bus. When the teens were found, police discovered the weapons.
<p>
"Both said they carried the weapons for personal protection and at no time did they intend to use them on the victim," DeSpain said.
