<h2>Better transit would cut drunken driving</h2>

Dear Editor:
<p>
Drunken driving truly is a scourge in Wisconsin, yet your article highlighting its pervasiveness and its consequences failed to mention one aspect of the problem which is all too often neglected: transportation. We live in a state in which getting from point A to point B means driving a car and in which the only half-decent bus system shuts down around 10:30 on Saturday nights. Rather than crack down on drinking, which seems to be MADD's raison d'etre these days, we should focus on making it possible to get to and from the bar without the use of an automobile.
<p>
This is not to excuse those who drive after drinking: Doing so is a selfish and immoral act and clearly deserves harsh punishment. However, from a pragmatic point of view, ensuring a feasible and practical way of getting around at night will do far more to lower the number of drunken drivers on the road than will harsher punishments. Moreover, an effective transportation system would have additional benefits for the community at large by providing jobs, and reducing congestion, pollution and traffic accidents instead of just filling our jails and making diners abstain from having a beer with lunch or dinner for fear of running afoul of the proposed 0.05 BAC limit.
