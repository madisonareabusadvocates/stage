Madison Police are investigating two separate incidents that they say took place on a bus.
<p>
Police responded to a report of a fight at the West transfer point, 5602 Tokay Blvd, at about 1 p.m. on Friday. They found a 22-year-old man with facial lacerations. He was taken to a hospital in an ambulance, where he learned he would require stitches.
<p>
The victim said he was involved in a verbal confrontation on a Metro bus. The confrontation became physical, and the suspect hit him in the face, police said. Witnesses told police the fight started on the bus, and ended in the parking lot at the transfer point.
<p>
The suspect boarded another bus and left the area, police said. Officers found the suspect, a 15-year-old Madison boy, at the intersection of Tokay and Midvale boulevards. They took him in to custody without incident, police said.
<p>
In another incident, a 45-year-old bus driver said he was assaulted by a group of teenagers after he told them to quiet down and took a picture of one with his cell phone.
<p>
The incident occurred at 7:30 p.m. Thursday in the 3500 block of Anderson Street at Madison Area Technical College, police said. Police are looking for four black teen-agers, three male and one female, each wearing all or almost all black clothing.
