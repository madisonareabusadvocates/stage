A 15-year-old Madison boy was arrested and tentatively charged with battery, disorderly conduct and carrying a concealed weapon Saturday afternoon after punching a Metro bus driver in the face before being grabbed by a 61-year-old bus passenger who held the suspect until police arrived.
<p>
The incident happened about 2:40 p.m. Saturday in the 2100 block of Continental Lane on the city's far east side.
<p>
Madison police said the 57-year-old bus driver told the teen to leave the bus after repeatedly pushing on the rear door, activating a safety light.
<p>
"The driver told the teen to stop messing with the door and to sit down, but the teen said if he was getting kicked off the bus, he wanted his fare back," said police spokesman Joel DeSpain.
<p>
The driver wouldn't give him his fare, so the teen punched the driver in the face. When he tried to run, the passenger stopped him and held him for the cops.
<p>
The driver complained of facial soreness after being punched; no one else was injured.
