Not only will some Metro buses have cameras rolling to catch trouble makers, Metro now has the authority to ban or restrict riders who cause problems.
<p>
Wednesday afternoon, the Common Council Board of Education Liaison Committee talked about the growing issue of violence on Metro buses, especially among students.
<p>
<q>I see on buses like fights, people nit picking with the like grown people, or they just slap them up side their head,</q> says Ida Brown, a Madison West High School Senior.
<p>
<q>Loud obnoxious people, people assaulting other people, there's no end of it,</q> says Ian, a Metro bus driver who did not want to give his last name.
<p>
One of the more violent fights at the West Transfer Point happened just this past January.
<p>
There were about 20 to 30 teens fighting there - they allegedly had baseball bats.
<p>
By this summer, 15 Metro buses will have video cameras rolling.</p>
