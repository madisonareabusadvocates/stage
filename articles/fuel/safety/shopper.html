A south side man returning home from grocery shopping was mugged on New Year's Eve after getting off a Metro bus, and the muggers took the groceries and beer he had just purchased.
<p>
The 52-year-old victim was taken to a local hospital with neck and back pain.
<p>
The mugging happened on West Badger Road near the Metro south transfer point about 7 p.m. on Dec. 31.
<p>
Madison police said the victim took a bus to a store to buy groceries and beer, then took a bus back to the transfer point before heading home.
<p>
"He started heading to his residence carrying grocery bags and pulling a wheeled cooler when two men jumped him," said police spokesman Joel DeSpain.
<p>
The man was knocked to the ground, kicked and punched, with the perpetrators stealing his purchases and fleeing on foot.
