<h2>The Pros And Cons Of Hybrid Buses</h2>
<h4><strong>WI State Journal, B3<br/>
Tues., Nov.1, 2005<br/>
State Journal staff, wire reports</strong></h4>

<p>MADISON</p>

<p>Converting Metro Transit's fleet of 220 buses to hybrid diesel-electric buses would save about $1.2 million in diesel fuel purchases each year, but hybrid buses cost an estimated $465,000 each, compared to around $290,000 for a new diesel bus, the Metro Transit general manager said Monday.</p>

<p>Moreover, Catherine Debo said in a report, the batteries on hybrid buses would have to be replaced every three to six years at a cost of $15,000 to $45,000 per vehicle. Buses last about 12 years.</p>

<p>The main benefit of hybrid buses, in addition to an estimated 35 percent increase in fuel economy, is lower emission levels, Debo said. Carbon monoxide emissions would drop from 3 grams per mile for diesel to 0.1 gram per mile with a hybrid bus, according to a 2001 study, she said. Carbon dioxide emissions would drop from 1,779 grams per mile for diesel to 2,262 with a hybrid, or an improvement of 517 grams.</p>

<p>Metro already has agreed to buy 15, 40-foot diesel buses in 2006, at a cost of around $272,000 per vehicle on a contract bid made three years ago.</p>

<p>Hybrid diesel-electric buses would be eligible for 80 percent federal funding. Today's estimates of $290,000 for a new diesel bus would mean a local share of $58,000 per vehicle. The local share for a similarly equipped hybrid bus would be $93,000, Debo said.</p>

<p>Note: Assuming $30,000 per battery and replacing them every 4.5 years, that's $17,600,000 for the fleet over 12 years - compared to a $14,400,000 savings in fuel. That's not taking into account the cost difference of the buses. However, it is also not factoring in the health savings benefits from having fewer pollution emissions in the city -- reduced asthma, stroke, heart attacks and cancer treatments. The costs of these illnesses are huge and could easily negate the extra money required to purchase and use hybrid city buses.</p>
