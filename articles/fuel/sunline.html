<h2>SunLine Transit introduces new hydrogen fuel cell bus</h2>
<h4><strong>12/7/2005</strong></h4>

<p>(PALM SPRINGS, CA) - In front of a robust crowd of media, dignitaries, and members of the 2005 Fuel Cell Seminar at the Palm Springs Convention Center, SunLine Transit Agency unveiled the bus of the future on a sun-splashed fall day in the Desert. The group attending the presentation included representatives for Assemblywoman Bonnie Garcia &amp; Senator Jim Battin, as well as members of the Federal Transit Agency, the Environmental Protection Agency, and other federal and technological agencies. This newest bus, to be added to SunLine's fleet in December, represents a dramatic jump forward in emission-free transportation.</p>

<p>Utilizing the most advanced fuel cell technology available, this hydrogen-fueled electric fuel cell bus has ZERO EMISSIONS! The only end-product is *good old' H<sup>2</sup>O... That's right, Water! According to the fuel cell manufacturer, UTC Power, you could drink right out of the tailpipe. Because of a non-combustion "engine" that has no moving parts, the bus is also virtually silent. It's hard for a 40-foot bus to creep up on anyone, yet that is exactly what happened as SunLine GM Mikel Oglesby was addressing the crowd at the November 16th unveiling. The spectators were not only surprised at the eerily quiet bus moving towards them, but also at the smooth ride, as all were invited for an inaugural ride after a ribbon-cutting ceremony.</p>

<p>To commemorate such a special bus, SunLine Transit Agency made sure it would look as good as it runs. Adorned with a water droplet graphic and bold "ZERO EMISSIONS" lettering, it'll be easily recognizable as it moves the Coachella Valley residents. And even though it looks good, there are some interesting features that make this bus unique in more ways than emissions. While it is a standard 40-foot long U.S. transit bus size, it has a unique three-door system that allows for easier access. Once stopped, the bus also has a tilting mechanism to allow for easy curbside loading - NO STEPPING UP! Most importantly, the center doors have an unfolding ramp for quick-and-easy wheelchair access. The ramp leads directly to the center of the bus, which is exclusively set up for handicapped seating.</p>

<p>The new SunLine bus is only one of four hydrogen fuel cell-powered transit vehicles of it's kind, and the transit agency is proud to have one running in the Coachella Valley. This bus is a major step in continuing SunLine's dedication to providing quality transportation to the Valley, while keeping an eye to preserving the environment for our children.</p>

<p>As referenced by Mr. Oglesby in his unveiling speech, the progression of SunLine's involvement in clean-fuel public transportation is like the ripple of water from the droplet. The waves of development began in the early 90's, and have hit their peak with this month's introduction of zero emission technology. The agency maintains and operates 47 buses and 23 paratransit vehicles, logging some 4 million miles each year in the Coachella Valley. For more information, call SunLine Transit Agency at (760) 343-3456.</p>
