<h2>Biodiesel Plant To Build In Deforest</h2>
<h4><strong>Wisconsin State Journal, LOCAL D6<br/>
Sunday, December 4, 2005<br/>
Associated Press</strong></h4>

<p>A recycling company is poised to break ground on Wisconsin's first biodiesel plant.</p>

<p>Green Bay-based Anamax Corp. plans to start construction Monday on the 12,300-square-foot plant next to its existing restaurant-grease recovery plant in DeForest.</p>

<p>DeForest village president Jeff Miller said the project could cost from $10 million to $15 million and create 10 to 15 jobs. The plant is expected to produce about 20 million gallons of biodiesel annually, according to the Wisconsin Soybean Marketing Board.</p>

<p>"It's a big deal," Miller said. "We'll be the first community in Wisconsin to have a biodiesel facility."</p>

<p>Biodiesel is an alternative fuel that can be made from vegetable oils or recycled cooking oil. It burns cleaner than traditional diesel, can run most diesel-fueled engines and help reduce dependence on foreign oil, according to the National Biodiesel Board.</p>

<p>More than 85 percent of biodiesel comes from soybeans, according to the national board.</p>

<p>State agriculture department spokesman Gary Radloff said the plant's presence could boost demand for Wisconsin soybeans. Dane County is the second-leading soybean producer in the state, Radloff said. Rock County directly to the south is first.</p>

<p>"They're really close to a lot of growers," Radloff said.</p>

<p>Miller said he's not sure how heavily the plant will rely on soybeans. Cole Buergi, a Green Bay-based public relations specialist handling media inquiries for Anamax, declined to comment on the plant, saying he didn't want an early news story to deter people from attending the groundbreaking.</p>

<p>"It's a little unknown what it might do," said Lodi soybean farmer Keith Ripp, president of the Wisconsin Soybean Marketing Board. "They'll probably purchase whatever is cheapest out there."</p>

<p>Nationally, biodiesel blends are sold at 450 retail pumps.</p>
