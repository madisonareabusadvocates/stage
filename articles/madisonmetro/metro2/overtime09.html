<h2>Outrageous overtime</h2>
<h4><strong>A Wisconsin State Journal editorial | Posted: Sunday, February 14, 2010</strong></h4>

<p>Nobody should work almost 80 hours a week for most of the year.</p>

<p>That's especially true if you're driving a 20-ton bus over sometimes slippery roads with riders constantly hopping aboard and jumping off.</p>

<p>Yet that's the number of hours during the typical week that the top-paid bus driver at Metro Transit worked last year to earn annual pay of $159,258, according to bus system officials.</p>

<p>The city needs to fix its union contract with bus drivers so excessive and concentrated overtime pay can't continue.</p>

<p>It's not safe. It wastes money. And it raises suspicion that taxpayers are being exploited.</p>

<p>The State Journal just reported the highest paid city employee during 2009 was bus driver John E. Nelson, who earned the $159,258. The mayor, by comparison, earned $112,880.</p>

<p>Seven bus drivers in all earned more than $100,000 each — even though the top pay for the job is $26 an hour, which would produce an annual salary of around $54,000. But their union contract gives bus drivers with the most seniority first dibs at time-and-a-half overtime, allowing their pay to skyrocket.</p>

<p>Nelson, for example, earned about $100,000 in overtime. For that amount of money, the city could have hired two additional drivers.</p>

<p>Part of the problem last year was the mayor's hiring freeze, which he lifted after learning it was triggering more expensive overtime.</p>

<p>But the biggest factor seems to be contract language limiting Metro Transit's ability to hire and use part-time drivers when they're most needed. Add to that an unusual jump in claims under the Federal Medical Leave Act.</p>

<p>Metro general manager Chuck Kamp said Friday about three-quarters of the increase in overtime in 2009 was caused by an 8,000-hour (44 percent) increase in FMLA time off.</p>

<p>Kamp said Metro Transit is analyzing why that was so high. Metro also is working with the Teamsters, who represent the bus drivers, to control vacancies and absenteeism, he said.</p>

<p>The city needs to make sure drivers aren't gaming the system by calling in sick for a shift only to work the very next shift for overtime pay. That's what some state prison guards were doing several years ago. Kamp said he's confident that isn't happening here.</p>

<p>The city is now negotiating its next contract. It needs to be tough and win concessions, particularly on the use of part-time drivers.</p>

<p>Taxpayers can afford an efficient bus system — but not a gravy train for select employees.</p>
