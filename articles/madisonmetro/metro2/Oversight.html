<h2>Jerry Darda: Public service needs fiscal oversight</h2>
<h4><strong>The Wisconsin State Journal, February 10, 2010</strong></h4>

<p>Sunday's article on Madison's highest paid employees stimulated the following observations:</p>

<p>First, the Madison Metro Transit drivers who earned six-figure wages with overtime no doubt worked longer hours than any other city employees and deserved their pay.</p>

<p>Second, the drivers' teamster union rules have created an environment of abuse with excessive absenteeism as well as a severely disproportionate distribution of wages based on seniority. The drivers are taking advantage of excessive sick days, which are a disincentive to work.</p>

<p>On the other hand, generous overtime wages offered to the most senior drivers is a great incentive to do additional work. The result is that Metro is spending too much on wages, and most is going to too few drivers.</p>

<p>This parallels corporate America where the company's top managers reward themselves with the highest wages compared to their workers.</p>

<p>The fundamental difference is that most corporations (bailed-out banks excluded) are owned by private individuals who risked their own money to make a profit and have a perfect right to generously reward themselves. But Madison Metro Transit is subsidized by our tax dollars, and the taxpayers should insist on better fiscal management or consider private-sector bus service.</p>

<p>— Jerry Darda, Madison</p>
