<h2>Mayor: No more $100,000+ bus drivers</h2>
<h4><strong>Wisconsin State Journal, February 26, 2010<br/>
By DEAN MOSIMAN | dmosiman@madison.com</strong></h4>

<p>Mayor Dave Cieslewicz doesn't want city bus drivers earning six-figures due to overtime and other compensation anymore.</p>

<p>Cieslewicz has asked Metro Transit General Manager Chuck Kamp, bus drivers union leader Gene Gowey and others to find a solution to absenteeism and staff shortfalls that created a demand for overtime and let one driver earn $159,258 and six others more than $100,000 in 2009.</p>

<p>The mayor said Metro is "very well managed," but suffering due to absenteeism and provisions of a union contract that limits the use of part-time drivers and gives senior employees who make the most money first crack at extra work.</p>

<p>"I don't begrudge the individuals from working hard," Cieslewicz said. "(But) we have an issue: a lot of drivers being off work for various reasons. We have to take a look at that and try to get the rate of absenteeism down."</p>

<p>Kamp, Gowey, city Human Resources Director Brad Wirtz and the mayor's fiscal efficiency auditor, Andrew Statz, will conduct the review, Cieslewicz said.</p>

<p>"I want to approach this cooperatively with the union," the mayor said.</p>

<p>Kamp welcomed the move.</p>

<p>"I think it's very helpful," he said. "We are looking under all rocks to find ways we can work on this."</p>

<p>Gowey did not return calls.</p>

<p><strong>Overtime over budget</strong></p>

<p>City records show Metro was $290,000 under budget for salaries, but $467,200 over budget for overtime in 2009. The agency spent $1.94 million on overtime that year, the most ever.</p>

<p>"I am not alarmed there was overtime," Transit and Parking Commission Chairman Gary Poulson said. "I do have concerns about the amount of time involved here."</p>

<p>Driver John E. Nelson, who could not be reached through Metro or the union, earned $159,258 in 2009, including $109,892 in overtime and other pay, the highest earnings of any city employee, city records show. Seven drivers earned more than $100,000, and 23 others between $70,000 and $100,000 last year. Of those 30 drivers, 11 earned more than $25,000 in overtime pay.</p>

<p>The bus drivers' contract, which calls for pay up to $26.02 per hour, expired at the end of December and the sides are in negotiations. Senior drivers make about $39 an hour working overtime.</p>

<p>All the overtime -- those driving most worked 50- to 80-hour weeks, including Nelson -- didn't compromise safety, Kamp said. Drivers making more than $100,000 had no preventable accidents and solid customer service records in 2009, he said.</p>

<p>Metro, Kamp said, had a five-year low in preventable accidents in 2009 and got an insurance premium reduction of $204,000 for its record.</p>

<p>Still, Poulson would like to see changes.</p>

<p>"I do want Metro to provide a safe service," he said. "I think there should be a realistic limit to the number of hours a driver can be on the road."</p>

<p>The new contract should allow more liberal use of part-time drivers, he said.</p>

<p><strong>Mechanics had high earnings, too</strong></p>

<p>Metro mechanics also had high earnings driven by overtime, records show. Seven mechanics earned between $70,000 and $99,900 last year, with overtime pay ranging from $19,000 to $36,000.</p>

<p>Drivers and mechanics -- like all employees in the state pension plan -- are motivated to mount high earnings because pensions are based on their highest earning years.</p>

<p>Concern about bus driver earnings first surfaced after Metro changed from a Downtown hub to a transfer station system in 1998.</p>

<p>In 1997, before the change, no driver made more than $70,000. Two years later, as Metro struggled to fill vacancies, two drivers topped $100,000 and seven others more than $70,000.</p>

<p>Since then, such earnings have "ebbs and flows," Cieslewicz said, adding that he wants to see the trend ended at the close of 2010.</p>
