<h2>Metro System Would Gain From Minibuses</h2>
<h4><strong>The Capital Times :: EDITORIAL :: A9<br/>
Wednesday, April 25, 2007<br/>
Susan Hagstrom, Madison</strong></h4>

<p>Dear Editor: I am a daily bus rider in Madison, mainly rush hour to work.</p>

<p>The way I see it, the bus system is in a Catch-22 situation regarding any new bus routes. To have success with a route, the route needs riders, but no one wants to ride the bus if they have the perception they can't get around easily and promptly. (In the evenings and midday, many routes only run once an hour, making many unwilling to use them, as you have to plan activities exactly to use the bus. No flexibility.)</p>

<p>I think the bus system, including the lower turnout hours, would benefit from getting smaller minibuses. One could purchase minibuses that have much better gas mileage, saving money which could be used to make routes more often, destroying the perception that individuals can't get around promptly on the bus.</p>

<p>The other thing that would be good would be for the Metro to consider trying to organize routes around activities. For example, they could consider running mini-routes around the movie theaters on the outskirts of town, scheduled to reach the theaters when the shows start, or when there is a big production at the Kohl Center or Overture. They do it for football games, with some success, I believe.</p>
