<h2>Metro and its opportunities</h2>
<h4><strong>An editorial from The Capital Times<br/>
Published: February 2, 2007 as http://www.madison.com/tct/opinion/index.php?ntid=117325</strong></h4>

<p>Madison's bus system is certainly not perfect. But as local officials work to improve its routes, its schedules and the varied services its provides, it is important to recognize that they are starting not from a place of weakness but a place of strength.</p>

<p>According to a new report from the state Department of Transportation, the Metro system ranks as the most efficient of 12 similar-sized systems in cities in the country. Costs were lower and ridership was higher than in any of the comparable communities.</p>

<p>The report makes a mockery of the anecdotal complaints of mass-transit critics who see an empty bus at an off-hour and think it means the system is underutilized and overly expensive. It also gives needed encouragement to proponents of public transportation who know that now is the time to expand Metro services.</p>

<p>"There's a lot to be excited about in this report," said Mayor Dave Cieslewicz. "What these numbers tell you is it's an efficient service compared to other services, and it's serving people's needs."</p>

<p>That doesn't mean that anyone should be popping champagne corks.</p>

<p>As the new Metro manager, Charles Kamp, notes, the system certainly needs improvement. What sort of improvement? The city's Long Range Metro Transit Planning Ad Hoc Committee is reviewing proposals to:</p>

<ul>
<li>Expand routes beyond the current service areas of Madison, Fitchburg and Middleton to reach communities such as Cross Plains, Monona, Sun Prairie, Oregon, Stoughton and Evansville.</li>
<li>Get Metro working more closely with employers who buy passes with volume discounts and give them free to their workers.</li>
<li>Identify alternative technologies to build on innovations such as the five diesel-electric hybrid buses that will be introduced in August.</li>
<li>Make Metro rides more appealing and convenient by adding amenities.</li>
</ul>

<p>This is a good starting agenda for building on the system's strengths. But the end point is more complicated. There are many proposals for how to expand mass transit options in Dane County - from light rail to trolleys to new highway schemes such as the North Beltline.</p>

<p>It should be clear by now that an expanded bus system is the basic building block for any overall transportation plan for the county. We favor rail options, for a variety of reasons. But if the Metro system really is as strong as it seems, then it may be appropriate to ask whether it makes sense to experiment with those options. Ultimately, we think that the case can be made for rail. But it certainly appears reasonable to suggest that any rail system be developed with an eye toward an integration with Metro that would ensure the continued vitality of the bus system.</p>
