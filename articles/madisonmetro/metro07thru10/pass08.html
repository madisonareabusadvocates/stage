<h2>Just ask us: Metro Transit's ride pass program helps its budget</h2>
<h4><strong>Wisconsin State Journal, December 31, 2008<br/>
by Dean Mosiman</strong></h4>

<p><strong>Q: How does the "free" Metro Transit service provided to UW-Madison and city employees — but not state employees as many assume — figure into the Metro Transit budget problems that lead to the proposal to increase fares 50 cents?</strong></p>

<p>A: A lot.</p>

<p>But the look of the ride pass program is deceiving, Metro officials say.</p>

<p>"The rides are not 'free,'" Metro spokesman Mick Rusch said. "Although it feels like a free ride to the passenger, Metro is reimbursed for every ride under these programs."</p>

<p>Currently, Metro gets 95 cents each time a UW-Madison student or employee rides a bus, a rate that increased from 88 cents in early 2008, and will go up again in 2010 to at least $1, perhaps more if the proposed fare increase is approved, Rusch said.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, fuel price increases and declining shares of state funding for transit have not been offset by the passenger revenue increases, and that contributed to the fare increase proposed in the 2009 budget, Rusch said.</p>

<p>In general, however, the university programs for unlimited ride passes have significantly helped Metro's budget, Rusch said.</p>

<p>"It brings in volumes of people who ride the bus," he said. "Every time they ride, we charge (the university or Associated Students of Madison)."</p>

<p>The UW-Madison fare program has brought over $1 million a year since 2005, he said.</p>

<p>The city pays for its employee program, so that effort doesn't produce a net revenue.</p>

<p>So far, the state has not entered into a pass program for its employees, Rusch said, but there have been discussions about one.</p>

<p>"We're looking into it," he said. "As of now, it hasn't been set up."</p>

<p>The Transit and Parking Commission voted to reject Mayor Dave Cieslewicz's proposed 50-cent fare hike and related increases, which would have raised about $680,000.</p>

<p>But the mayor has asked Metro staff to further analyze the implications of no fare increase, and the commission is scheduled to reconsider the matter on Jan. 13.</p>
