<h2>Metro Bus Cuts Will Create Hardship</h2>
<h4><strong>The Capital Times Editorial<br/>
John Pollard<br/>
Thursday, June 1, 2006</strong></h4>

<p>Dear Editor: I attended the May 22 public hearing on the route changes for the Madison Metro system. The Transit Commission did not consider the needs of the riders whose only form of transportation is the Metro bus system -- and especially the riders who suffer from disabilities.</p>

<p>These riders will suffer severe cuts to their service in August 2006, and in some cases there will be no service for their area. It was apparent that the commission members have no sympathy for these hard-working people and their inability to get to work, school, church, food shopping, and social activities.</p>

<p>Last week, I was extremely lucky to move from the Allied Drive area to downtown so that I can get to work in one hour instead of two hours. In fall my former bus stop on Red Arrow Trail/Jenewein will only receive hourly versus half hour service. Additionally, the 6:30 a.m. Saturday bus on Route 18 will be eliminated. I needed this bus to get to work!</p>

<p>During the hearing, Catherine Debo made the comment that the violence on the buses and at the transfer points is blown out of proportion. I invite her to live on Allied Drive and ride the very violent Route 18. Many of the Route 18 drivers and passengers legitimately fear for their lives, especially when there is a large group of kids on the bus.</p>

<p>I am so thankful I no longer live on Route 18 because of the violence on the bus and at the South and West Transfer Points. The future reduction in service would not allow me to get to my job or keep my job, which will give me health insurance in three more months.</p>
