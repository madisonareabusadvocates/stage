<h2>City's transportation fiasco self-inflicted</h2>

Dear Editor:
<p>
For the first time in the several years I've known Hans Noeldner, we fundamentally disagree.
<p>
Madison's transportation fiasco is entirely self-inflicted. A 60 percent increase in road spending -- from $40 million to $64 million -- is proof that the city is, in fact, in the money-printing business. But only for cars. Madison Metro is in the straits that it is in because of the pro-car, anti-transit development that the city continues to propagate.
<p>
Building anti-transit places means fewer riders to spread the operating costs across. It means many extra miles, and very little "route productivity" as they call it in the biz. The moment one of those over-stretched, rider-less bus lines heads into a transit-oriented neighborhood, the buses are instantaneously packed. It isn't a coincidence. Land use and transportation are inextricably dependent, the one upon the other. Build for the car, you get cars. Build for land use proximity and transportation choice, you get a lot of people walking, biking, car-pooling and riding the bus.
<p>
The city keeps making its car-only choice. Attached are some good examples of those choices.
<p>
How would you like to wait for a bus in these desolate places?
<p>
Exactly. That's why Mayor Dave Cieslewicz's planning decisions are so anti-transit.
<p>
