<div><h3>AD WRAP IS A BUS BOON</h3>

<strong>The Capital Times<br/>
p.C2</strong><br/>
<br/>
<p>August 10, 2007<br/>
BILL NOVAK Metro buses fully wrapped in colorful advertising for beer and bingo
have drawn criticism, but it's money in the bank for the financially strapped
Madison bus system.  Metro and ad supplier Adams Outdoor Advertising officials say the income
from advertisers putting their messages top to bottom and front to back, including
over side windows, will allow Metro to make more money from ads in 2007 than
ever before. Firm figures are hard to come by because advertisers have varying-length
contracts for the full wraps on buses, and not all of the maximum allotment
of 15 are ready to roll with their paint schemes. But Metro marketing and
customer service manager Julie Maryott-Walsh said "my guess is revenue
will be more than what we've made in the past." Adams general manager Chris Eigenberger said the full wrap ad plan has
been very successful since it started March 27 with two buses and now has
grown to nine with five more on the way. "It's generated more money for Metro than advertising in any other
previous year," Eigenberger said. But that's not reason enough for Kevin Hinkley, who brought a petition
to the City Council Tuesday opposing the wraps. More than 300 people signed
the document, which asks the city to stop using buses for advertising alcohol
and gambling. While acknowledging that there have been alcohol and gambling ads on buses
before, Hinkley said in an interview today that they were small and discreet. "As a community, we voted we didn't want a little bit of Vegas in
Madison," he said, referring to a failed 2004 referendum about casino
gambling in Dane County. "I also feel it sends a bad message to our kids, including my 14-year-old
son," Hinkley said. "They can't even wear T-shirts with alcohol
messages on them to school and now they will be riding buses to school with
those message emblazoned on the outside. It sends a mixed message." Madison Metropolitan School District spokesman Joe Quick, however, said
school district officials have been told that the wrapped buses are on high-volume
routes that do not include the morning and afternoon school routes to Madison
high schools and middle schools. "I'm told those buses will never be considered for school routes," Quick
said. <b>BIG MONEY </b> The city has a three-year contract with Adams to sell full wrap ads on
up to 15 buses, the limit imposed by the Transit and Parking Commission. The contract pays the city $22,727 a month in the first year, $29,167 a
month the second year and $18,750 a month the third year, so Metro will make
at least $272,727 the first year, $350,000 the second year and $225,000 the
third year. Metro and Adams also will share revenues over and above the contract, with
the bus service getting 40 percent and Adams 60 percent of revenues above
the contracted amounts. Adams sells full wrap ads for $4,000 per bus every four-week period (the
minimum contract length), with the cost dropping to $3,600 a period if the
advertiser buys an annual contract. If all 15 buses were painted in full wrap schemes for a year at a time,
advertisers would be paying more than $700,000, and Metro would make $553,000,
more than double the contracted amount the first year. Nine buses are wrapped with ads now with five more coming soon, when GM
and Lexus start advertising new hybrid vehicles on five new diesel-electric
hybrid buses Metro is taking delivery on in September. DeJope Gaming and Einstein Wireless were the first to purchase full wrap
transit ads in March, putting their colors on one bus each. Since then, Charter
Communications wrapped five buses and Miller Brewing wrapped two buses in
Miller Genuine Draft advertising. The gambling and beer wraps raised the ire of some residents who filed
a protest with the mayor's office to get the city to stop using public transit
to advertise gambling and alcohol, but Maryott-Walsh said it's nothing new. "We've had ads for Kessler whiskey and Ho-Chunk casino for years,
but those ads weren't full wrap," she said, adding that the new revenue
stream from the full wrap advertising means fewer budgetary headaches. "I'd rather have the income from the full wrap ads than cut services
or increase rates," Maryott-Walsh said. "Transit is expensive to
operate." City policy won't allow certain advertising for tobacco products,
or if the ad is deemed obscene, libelous or fraudulent. Risque? Maybe. "We had a full back (covers the exterior rear) on a bus for an intimate
apparel store on Monroe Street," Maryott-Walsh said. Eigenberger said Adams won't accept ads on buses for adult-oriented businesses
such as a bookstore or a strip club, but alcohol and gambling is acceptable. "It's a concern from some people but well before the wrapped buses
were on the road we sold casino and beer ads on buses, so it's not new," he
said. Madison Metro is one of a dozen city bus systems in Wisconsin that have
full wrap advertising on city buses, the others being Milwaukee, Green Bay,
Beloit, Eau Claire, La Crosse, Appleton, Waukesha, Janesville, Beloit, Stevens
Point and Baraboo. <br/>
