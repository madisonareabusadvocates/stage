<h2>FUTURE OF METRO'S BUS WRAPS, PROFITABLE BUT UNPOPULAR WITH RIDERS, IS UNCLEAR</h2>

<h4>Wisconsin State Journal, July 2, 2008<br> By DEAN MOSIMAN dmosiman@madison.com 608-252-6141</h4>

<p>Bold, colorful and on wheels, they're the ultimate rolling billboards.</p>
<p>But many say the full advertising "wraps" that cover Metro Transit buses and their passenger windows make rides unpleasant and, from the outside, can be loud, ugly and carry messages promoting alcohol or gambling.</p>
<p>The full wraps, however, are a new, much-needed source of revenue for a bus system struggling with increasing service demands, rising fuel prices and escalating costs, others contend.</p>
<p>Now, the Madison City Council will decide whether to continue a pilot program that allows a limited number of fully wrapped buses or end the full wraps and lose the revenue - a $75,000 difference next year and at least $175,000 annually in the future.</p>
<p>Two important issues - customer satisfaction and revenue - "are at odds," said Ald. Satya Rhodes-Conway, 12th District, who opposes full wraps. "That's unfortunate."</p>
<p>In fact, two of the city's most influential committees have taken opposing stands on what to allow on Metro's 200-bus fleet.</p>
<p>The Transit and Parking Commission wants to permanently allow 20 full-wrapped buses and an unlimited number of wraps that leave some windows uncovered. The Board of Estimates, the city's financial committee, recommends no full wraps, 40 wraps that cover some windows, and unlimited advertising that covers no windows.</p>
<p>"We are very aware of all the concerns ... but in this day and age, we need the revenue," Metro spokesman Mick Rusch said.</p>
<p>Mayor Dave Cieslewicz, while not endorsing either committee proposal, supports full bus wraps as a good means of getting revenue, spokesman George Twigg said.</p>
<p>The council is expected to make a decision on July 2.</p>
<p><b>ONLY A PILOT PROGRAM</b>
<p>The two-year pilot program, begun in 2007, initially allowed 15 fully wrapped buses, but the council boosted the number to 20 during last fall's budget deliberations.</p>
<p>A three-year contract with Adams Outdoor Advertising provides Metro with $273,000 the first year and $350,000 this year, but only $225,000 in the contract's final year in 2009, assuming no full wraps are allowed. If the contract is extended and at least 15 full wraps are allowed, the payment would be at least $300,000 next year, jump to $400,000 in 2010 and $450,000 by 2012.</p>
<p>Full wraps are by far the most attractive product for advertising on buses because of the potential for creativity and the impact, Adams regional manager Chris Eigenberger said.</p>
<p>"They're new to Madison," he said, but "around the country, it's something that's been done for years. We can make more money for the city with full wraps included in our packages."</p>
<p>Wraps that cover some windows are attractive, too, but not as desirable as the full ones, Eigenberger said.</p>
<p>The advertising revenue from the wraps represents a small portion of Metro's $48.7 million budget for 2008, which includes $9.8 million from city taxpayers and the rest from fares, contracts and outside sources.</p>
<p>Still, a draft of the bus system's long-range plan, recognizing tight resources and mounting demand, calls for Metro to secure 1 percent of its funding through advertising, or about $500,000.</p>
<p>"If someone says it's all about the money, they're absolutely right," said Transportation and Parking Committee Chairman Carl Durocher.</p>
<p><b>'IN A SARDINE CAN'</b>
<p>Full wraps have generated a negative, even harsh, response, as riders must look through a honeycomb-like mesh applied to windows and onlookers encounter a colorful, head-turning message.</p>
<p>In a Metro rider survey, 60 percent of respondents said the full-wrap had a negative effect, while 33 percent said it had no effect and 7 percent found a positive effect.</p>
<p>Bus rider David Waugh also submitted a survey of 83 Downtown and near East Side Listserv members who mostly criticize the wraps.</p>
<p>Caitlyn Lantz, who was riding a fully wrapped bus on Friday, said the mesh is annoying.</p>
<p>"You can't see at night," she said, adding that she once missed her stop and had to walk a mile.</p>
<p>Others voice concern about queasiness and the feeling of being "in a sardine can."</p>
<p>Metro, in fact, has removed the covering from windows near the front door to improve visibility for bus drivers.</p>
<p>Ald. Mike Verveer, 4th District, who represents the core Downtown, said, "I have had nothing but complaints about the full-wrap buses."</p>
<p>The inability to see inside the bus from the outside can even pose a safety concern, Verveer said.</p>
<p><b>MIXED REACTION</b>
<p>The comment and surveys have gotten the attention of officials.</p>
<p>"I think it's very important to keep riders happy," Durocher said.</p>
<p>But everybody doesn't have a problem with the full wraps. Angelo Lloyd, riding the same bus as Lantz because his car broke down, said the wrap is cool and keeps the sun out.</p>
<p>And at the South Transfer Station on Saturday, a sampling of riders didn't seem to mind them, either, saying good service trumps aesthetics.</p>
<p>Carl Williams, surveying a station floor littered with cigarette butts, said Metro could use more money for maintenance.</p>
<p>Some complain about full wraps promoting beer or gambling, but the city can't be selective due to constitutional protections, Rusch and Eigenberger said.</p>
<p>The rider surveys are a bit "disingenuous" because they ask about wraps without the context of lost revenue, which could mean service cuts, higher fares or increased property taxes, said Ald. Zach Brandon, 7th District.</p>
<p>In fact, half of respondents said they'd change their perception if revenue were factored in, Rusch said.</p>
<p>And while important, survey results represent only a fraction of Metro's 12.7 million riders, Eigenberger said.</p>
<p><b>MORE CHANGES AHEAD </b>
<p>Metro, seeing its highest ridership in 25 years, has restructured routes three times since 2000 - including service cuts each time as part of the package - with another set of changes set for October that are designed to ease crowding on buses and improve on-time performance.</p>
<p>"My ultimate goal is to maintain the current level of bus service," Brandon said. "To do that, we have to have this revenue in place."</p>
<p>"I'm looking for a compromise," Rhodes-Conway said. "We can get some kind of revenue stream but we don't have to cover all the windows."</p>
<p>The city should continue to seek alternative sources of revenue for the bus system, but remember it's a cornerstone basic service, Rhodes-Conway said.</p>
<p>The best, perhaps distant hope, is a regional transit system with a larger tax base, many agreed.</p>
<p>"If we really treat Metro as a basic service, we ought to fund it accordingly," Rhodes-Conway said. <br> -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
