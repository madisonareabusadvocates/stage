Kamp said staff (the Service Development Committee) would go through and
reflect on the ADATS comments before they came back with a
recommendation. Staff wanted the Commission to be aware of the memo that
was dated 1/8/14, but didn't expect the Commission to take action on it at this
point.<br/>
