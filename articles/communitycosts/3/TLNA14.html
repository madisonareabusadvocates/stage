East Johnson Street Planning Representatives of Madison Metro came to the TLNA Annual meeting to
outline proposed changes to the placement and number of bus stops along E. Johnson Street as well as similar changes proposed for East Gorham Street. They are planning to eliminate a few stops on both streets to increase route speeds. In addition a public hearing was held to allow for “Work between the hours of 7:00 PM to 7:00 AM … on a limited basis when deemed necessary…” during the 2014 E. Johnson reconstruction project. Such work must be preapproved by the City Engineer. This is a relatively standard provision for the magnitude of work being done and no neighborhood objections have come forth.
