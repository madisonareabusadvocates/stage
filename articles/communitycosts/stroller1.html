  <h3>Madison buses may require parents with small children to fold strollers</h3>

Parents should fold up strollers when they board buses for safety reasons, transit officials say. But now Metro Transit may make them.
<p>
Metro Transit spokesman Mick Rusch said there was a recent instance where a stroller tipped over with a child in it when a bus turned a corner.
<p>
"That's just the kind of thing that we're worried about," he said. "It's a safety thing. We also understand that it's an issue that could have potential inconvenience for passengers. We're trying to find the balance. That's why we're having this public hearing."
<p>
Metro Transit is holding a public hearing July 13 to get opinions on whether the agency should start more strictly enforcing its stroller policy. A flier also went out on buses June 21 that has a survey and feedback form.
<p>
In its rules for passenger conduct, Metro Transit asks passengers not to block the aisle or restrict passenger movement with large articles including non-collapsible strollers. It also asks passengers to remove children from strollers and fold the strollers during the ride.
<p>
If it enforces the policy, those who refuse to fold and stow their strollers will be unable to ride.
<p>
"We do get a lot of strollers," said driver Heath Harrison, estimating that 95 percent of riders with strollers don't fold them up when they board the bus.
<p>
Harrison said he doesn't enforce Metro's stroller policy unless there's no room on the bus. Sometimes he will have three or four strollers on the bus at one time, and said that riders are compliant about folding them when they realize there's no room.
<p>
Strollers also compete for space on the bus with wheelchairs, walkers and other mobility aids, said Metro Transit General Manager Chuck Kamp.
<p>
Frequent bus rider Robert Watson said riders with strollers rarely move out of the way for disabled passengers.
<p>
"People who have strollers think they have a divine right to the handicapped spots," he said.
<p>
Madison Ald. Satya Rhodes-Conway doesn't have children and doesn't use strollers, but said that Metro buses should be more welcoming for everyone to ride.
<p>
"Asking parents to take their kids out of a stroller and fold up the stroller and carry that in addition to whatever else they're carrying and manage all of that on the bus is really a discouragement for parents with young children and it's an insult for parents who are transit dependent," she said.
<p>
Amanda White, vice chairperson of the Madison Transit and Parking Commission, said she's waiting to hear from the public on the matter before making up her mind.
<p>
"There's two sides to the story," White said. "There's the safety side ... But there's also the user side, or the convenience side, and we don't want to do anything to discourage mothers bringing children onto the buses and making it more inconvenient for certain people to ride the bus."<br>
