<h3>Reasons for Reducing Car Travel in Madison</h3>
<strong>Part 1 of 2</strong><br/>
<br/>
<em>Michael T. Neuman<br/>
January 12, 2006</em>
<p>By public health standards, air quality within the City of Madison has already surpassed the threshold level of particulates within the air from motor vehicle and other combustion emission sources at which the Department of Natural Resources has had to issue an air quality health advisory.  Particulate levels in Madison and vicinity's air during 2005 exceeded safe levels a total of 9 days during 2005.  
<p>
On those days, the DNR had to issue an advisory to the public in the Madison area to use caution and try to reduce their exposure to particulate levels of pollution, and to reduce driving and other activities that contribute to combustion emissions.  
<p>
The air quality index for the Madison area on those days registered into the "orange level", the level at which the DNR, and the U.S. EPA, consider the air to be unhealthy for people in sensitive groups, such as those with heart or lung disease, asthma, older adults and all children, and including people who are not in  sensitive groups but who are engaged in strenuous activities, or who are exposed for prolonged periods of time.
<p>
Under an orange level advisory, all people are advised to reschedule or cut back on strenuous activities activities.  People with lung diseases, such as asthma and bronchitis and heart disease, are advised to pay attention to cardiac symptoms like chest pain and
shortness of breath, or respiratory symptoms like coughing, wheezing and discomfort when taking a breath, and consult with their physician if they experienced those symptoms.  Obviously, the City of Madison should strive to attain no days of the year under which its air quality is in the orange or worse levels.
<p>
There were also 4 days in Madison last year when pollution levels, again from motor vehicle emissions and other sources of combustion, were very close the levels at which Madison's air quality at the ground level exceeded the Federal Clean Air Act standard. Dane County instituted a program a couple years ago that alerts the Madison area public of when air quality in Dane County is nearing the ground level ozone standard - called "Clean Air Action Days" (there is no such
similar program for particulate pollutants) and requests they cut back on driving and other fuel burning during the day.
<p>
There is ample scientific basis for the DNR to issue public health advisories when the levels of particulates in the air exceed the safety threshold levels for particulates, and for Dane County to issue Clean Air Action Days.  Numerous scientific studies show higher hospitalization rates for asthmatics, and increased prevalence of childhood leukemia and other forms of cancer, and a higher incidence of heart attacks and strokes in populations that live near heavily traveled roads.
<p>
A study conducted in San Diego County in the 1990s showed residents who already had asthma reported more trips to hospitals if they lived within a distance of within 550 feet to a heavily traveled highway.<a href="#FOOT1"><sup>1</sup></a>
<p>
According to a study published in the American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine, living near a busy road could also increase a child's chances of getting bronchitis or asthma in the first place.<a href="#FOOT2"><sup>2</sup></a>
<p>
It is the fine pollution particles (the mostly unseen  ones) that are emitted from operating motor vehicle emissions which are the most injurious as they lodge deep into human lung tissue. The problem occurs most frequently in children because children are more likely
to be breathing deeper as their lung capacity is  smaller and they are more often engaged in active outdoor activities that require faster and deeper breathing.<a href="#FOOT3"><sup>3</sup></a>
<p>
Pollution emissions from motor vehicles can also trigger ischemia, a potentially catastrophic shortage of oxygen to the heart muscle.<a href="#FOOT4"><sup>4</sup></a>
<p>
A study by New York's Columbia Center for Children's Environmental Health concludes that babies in the womb are more sensitive than their mothers to pollutants from motor vehicle tailpipes and other combustion sources.<a href="#FOOT5"><sup>5</sup></a>
<p>
The medical journals are filled with reports of scientific studies that link human exposure to even moderate levels of particulates from automobile emissions to increased risk of getting asthma, asthma
attacks, bronchitis, heart attack, stroke and cancer. A report prepared by the Sierra Club documents many other of the known health hazards for people who live near heavily traveled highways.<a href="#FOOT6"><sup>6</sup></a>
<p>
Recently, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has issued proposed revisions to the National Ambient Air Quality Standards for particle pollution that reduce even further the number of fine particles that can be present in the air for it to be considered in compliance with the Clean Air Act. Presently, the annual (average) standard for fine particulates is 15 micrograms per cubic meter and that standard would remain unchanged. The current daily (maximum)
standard for fine particulates is 65 micrograms, and EPA proposes a reduction to 35 particles per cubic meter cubed.
<p>
The American Lung Association claims the proposed limits are still not low enough to protect public health and will lead to thousands of premature deaths. The American Lung Association states that, despite
the strong scientific consensus by an independent outside scientific review panel and the EPA's own staff scientists that stricter standards are needed to protect public the health, EPA is proposing the standards anyway.
