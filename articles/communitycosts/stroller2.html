In a blast from SOS' past, Metro Transit will hold a public hearing July 13 to discuss plans for more strictly enforcing the bus line's stroller policy.
<p>
In October 2008, SOS detailed the beef Metro rider Bob Watson had with Metro's failure to enforce the policy, which requires those toting strollers onto the bus to fold them up. Instead, parents and their stroller-borne kids have been allowed to take up space at the front of the bus reserved for the elderly and disabled.
<p>
If Metro decides to take a tougher stand on strollers, the change would be implemented over two months, after which riders who don't comply could be kicked off.
<p>
The hearing begins at 6 p.m. in Room 260 of the Madison Municipal Building, 215 Martin Luther King Jr. Blvd.
