<h3>Transportation and the Environment</h3>
<h4><em>Fact Sheet of the Surface Transportation Policy Project</em></h4>


<p><i>Transportation investments, services and incentives should meet our
    travel needs, promote economic prosperity and environmental justice, preserve
    and protect open space, scenic resources and agricultural land, protect and
    enhance the integrity of natural resource systems and wild places and improve
    air and water quality. Such efforts can promote resource efficiency and energy
    conservation, while reducing reliance on foreign oil and offering solutions
    to climate change.</i> –  New Transportation Charter</p>
<p><br/>
</p>
<p>The impact of transportation on quality of life is perhaps most easily seen
   in environmental degradation. America's auto-oriented transportation system
   dirties the air, contaminates oceans and rivers, consumes open space and wildlife
   habitat, hastens climate change, and guzzles energy.</p>
<h4>Transportation is a Significant Source of Air Pollution</h4>
  More than 125 million Americans live in areas with unacceptable air pollution.
  The EPA attributes the premature deaths of over 64,000 Americans to air pollution
  annually. Asthma, lung and respiratory illnesses, and heart disease are also
  exacerbated by air pollution. Economically disadvantaged communities tend to
  be disproportionately affected by these public health problems. In addition
  to negative impacts on human health and environmental justice, air pollution
  in the form of smog and acid rain have been shown to kill or harm agricultural
  crops and damage buildings at a cost of between $2 and $3 billion annually. <imgalign="right" border="0" height="91" src="http://www.madison.com/communities/mabaa/library/files/environment2.gif" width="250" alt="Environment2"/>
<p> Motor vehicles are the largest source of urban air pollution, generating
   more than two-thirds of the carbon monoxide in the atmosphere, a third of
   the nitrogen oxides (which react to form smog), and a quarter of the hydrocarbons
   (which also form smog). Some pollutants emitted by cars and trucks are known
   or likely to cause cancer, including toxic substances such as soot (fine particulates),
   benzene, arsenic compounds, formaldehyde, and lead. In the 1996 National Toxics
   Inventory, EPA estimates that mobile sources such as cars, trucks, and buses
   release about 3 billion pounds of cancer-causing, hazardous air pollutants
   each year.</p>
<h4> Roads are a Major Source of Water Pollution </h4>
  Transportation also has a significant impact on water quality. Runoff from
  roads, bridges, parking lots and other impervious surfaces can pollute drinking
  water and lead to changes in water chemistry that degrade habitat quality.
  This significant non-point pollution source deposits road salt, dirt and dust,
  fertilizers, pesticides, antifreeze, engine oil, rubber and metal deposits,
  litter and other pollutants into aquifers, lakes, rivers, streams and oceans.
  <p> A recent report from the Pew Oceans Commission finds that "when more
   than ten percent of the acreage of a watershed is covered in roads, parking
   lots, rooftops, and other impervious surfaces, the rivers and streams within
   the watershed become seriously degraded."</p>
<p> Groundwater contamination is also attributed to underground gasoline storage
   tanks (UST) which leak. One example is the gasoline additive MTBE which has
   been linked to hyperactivity, convulsions, kidney damage, and possibly cancer.</p>
<p> Finally, the necessity of moving millions of gallons of oil to serve motor
   vehicles has consequences for water quality: marine oil spills. The infamous
   Exxon Valdez spill in Alaska was only one of thousands of oil spills reported
   annually.</p>
<h4> Highways Threaten Wildlife and Habitat </h4>
  More than 1 million animals are killed on the nation's highways every day.
  But roadkill is just the most obvious way that an auto-oriented transportation
  network impacts wildlife. By altering, degrading, and destroying wildlife habitat,
  and by encouraging additional development, roads have helped bring dozens of
  species to the brink of extinction. Estimates of oil resources in the Arctic
  National Wildlife Refuge, which range from 3 billion barrels of oil to 16 billion
  barrels of oil, also put this natural habitat at risk.
  <p> (See STPP's fact sheet, Transportation and Biodiversity)</p>
<h4> Transportation Contributes to Climate Change </h4>
  According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), the 1990s
  were the hottest decade of the 20th century. The IPCC further predicts that
  the earth's average temperature will increase by as much as 10ð F during
  the next century, leading to record heat waves, droughts, an increase in frequency
  of severe storms, rising sea levels, and the migration of insect-borne tropical
  diseases like malaria.
  <p> Carbon dioxide (CO2) is the largest contributor to climate change and the
   transportation sector is one of the largest sources of CO2. Cars and light
   trucks emit 20 percent of the nation's CO2 pollution. Each gallon of gasoline
   burned pumps 28 pounds of CO2 into the atmosphere - 19 from the tailpipe
   and nine pounds from upstream refining, transporting and refueling. The U.S.
   transportation sector as a whole is responsible for about 32 percent of U.S.
   CO2 emissions, and almost nine percent of the world's total CO2 emissions.</p>
<h4> Transportation is Responsible for High Energy Consumption </h4>
  The transportation sector is over 95 percent dependent on oil. In 2000, cars
  and trucks guzzled 132 billion gallons of gasoline and an additional 33 billion
  gallons of diesel and other special fuels. Cars and trucks accounted for 43
  percent of all petroleum consumed in the U.S. in 2000 (EIA. Energy Outlook
  2002.). In fact, cars and light trucks consume more energy than domestic oil
  producers extract. And the trend is expected to worsen: The growing popularity
  of SUVs and trucks has led to a decrease in fuel economy, and the total U.S.
  fleet's fuel economy reached its lowest point since 1980 in 2001.
  <p> Americans spend over $100,000 per minute to purchase foreign oil, making
   oil consumption an important part of the national trade deficit. The transportation
   sector's dependence on oil is not fully reflected at the gas pump; it also
   drives US foreign policy.</p>
