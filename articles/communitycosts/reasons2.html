<h3>Reasons for Reducing Car Travel in Madison</h3>
<strong>Part 2 of 2</strong><br/>
<br/>
<em>Michael T. Neuman<br/>
January 12, 2006</em>
<p>The Association claims EPA's proposed annual standard of 15 micro grams (ug) of particles per cubic meter and daily standard of 35 ug particles per cubic meter annual average standard should be reduced to 12 and 25 ug, respectively. Additionally, the Association 
recommends EPA adopt a standard of "no more than four days in any year be above the daily standard of 12 ug", and that coarse particles be included in that standard as well.
<p>
"There is no scientific basis to determine that particles from any source - especially sources that can include toxics such pesticides and heavy metals - are safe for people to breathe", the Association
states.
<p>
What is needed to protect the health of Madison's resident population is a plan to reduce the overall increases in fuel burning in Madison so that health advisories and clean air action alerts don't need to
be issued.
<p>
Personal motor vehicle operation in and around Dane county is the one of the leading contributors to high ozone and particulate levels to Madison's air.  There needs to be a goal identified in the Comprehensive Plan that focuses more attention on the need to reduce
overall levels of motor vehicle driving in and around Madison. 
<p>
Reducing the annual number of motor vehicle miles driven in and around Madison by 20% by the year 2015 would help ensure Madison's air remains healthy to breathe and in compliance with the Federal Clean Air Act requirements.  
<p>
A 20% reduction in motor vehicle miles driven in Madison would also reduce traffic congestion, the potential for collisions and automobile-pedestrian and automobile-bicycling conflicts, and reduce the need for highway/street capacity expansion and maintenance. It
would also help Madison meet its climate protection commitments, since emissions from motorized transportation is undoubtedly the largest source of carbon dioxide emissions to the atmosphere in the Madison area as it is in the country as a whole.
<p>
Wisconsin is by no means immune from the dangers of global warming. There presently exists overwhelming scientific consensus that earth's climate is warming in response to rising concentrations of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. Fossil fuel burning in motorized transportation is the largest source of emissions of greenhouse gases in the U.S., followed by the industrial, residential and commercial sectors. In adopting its "Climate Protection Plan" (Final Update -
2002), the Madison Common Council recognized that local actions to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and increase energy efficiency provide many other local benefits including decreased air pollution, more jobs, reduced energy expenditures, and money saved for City government, its businesses and its citizens, in addition to helping to preserve Madison's hospitable climate for the future.
<p>
"Increasingly, cities are providing the answers to some of America's toughest problems. So it's fitting that we're leading the way on global warming as well", said Mayor Dave Cieslewicz in May 2005 upon his signing of the U.S. Mayor Climate Protection Agreement, which
presently has 195 mayoral endorsements from around the country.<a href="#FOOT7"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
<p>
A 20% reduction in motor vehicle driving would also improve Madison and Dane County's ranking as one of the more healthy areas of Wisconsin to raise a family.  The UW Population Health Institute released a study late in 2005 which ranks Wisconsin's 72 counties according to how healthy they are for people to live in the county.
Dane County missed out on being among the healthiest counties due to its poor air quality score.
<p>
The study attributed the poorer air quality in Dane County to too much motor vehicle traffic and suggested alternatives to automobile use along with stronger adherence to smart urban planning as a way to move up in the statewide county health rankings in 2006.<a href="#FOOT8"><sup>8</sup></a></p>
<p>
In conclusion, the City of Madison's Comprehensive Plan should include the goal of reducing motor vehicle miles traveled in the city by at least 20% of its current volume within ten years. This would make Madison's and Dane County's air cleaner to breathe, its sidewalks and bicycle paths safer and its economy and population more
sustainable.  There is too much single occupancy motor vehicle driving in Madison already, and it's time for a change to more sustainable modes of travel than the personal automobile.
<p>
Traffic densities on highway and arterial roads in Madison continue to increase and are a significant source of air pollutants, including airborne particulates. Wisconsin Department of Transportation estimates show the number of motor vehicle miles traveled (VMT) in Dane County has grown from 3.0 billion VMT* in 1990 to 4.9 billion VMT<a href="#FOOT9"><sup>9</sup></a> in 2004, an increase of 63%, which is over 2 and a half times Dane County's population growth rate of 23% (450,730 - 367,085)<a href="#FOOT10"><sup>10</sup></a>
during the same period.  Clearly, Dane County, Madison and residents of other south central counties surrounding Madison are driving more miles today than ever before.  It's time to drive less.  Driving twenty percent less, on average, shouldn't be all that difficult. It's for a good cause.
<p>
Per capita VMT in Dane County (a surrogate for the amount of driving done by Madisonions) grew from 8,172 miles per capita (MPC) in 1990 to 10,871 (MPC) in 2004 (a 33% increase). 
<p>
A 20% reduction in VMT using the county's current population would therefore amount to a reduction in vehicle miles traveled per capita per year to 8,697 miles, which still exceeds the average number of
miles driven per capita in 1990 by 525 miles per year.
