Transit for Madison</font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40"><font face="Arial">The City of Madison is growing, and as desirable things
get placed farther out we will need to be able to reach them with transit.&nbsp;
This is a proposal for implementing the Madison Metro Mover, nicknamed The
M.&nbsp; This idea is only in its infancy, an idea will likely change and evolve
as it moves forward.&nbsp; Rapid transit is the way to serve a growing city, and it also benefits the
downtown by making transit more attractive and keeping cars out of crowded
streets.&nbsp; Transit oriented development is not possible without good
efficient transit.&nbsp; Bus rapid transit, or BRT, could make other parts of
the city reachable for the crowd that travels on foot, and so, can lead to
redevelopment of places like Mineral Point Road and East Washington Avenue.&nbsp;
Periphery routes that previously all had to come downtown to attract commuters
can serve as local circulators, making their rides more efficient and opening up
more cross-town trips to potential bus riders.</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 40"><font face="Arial"><b><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:VOTC9218.jpg">Vehicles</a>
- </b></font>Could be a standard city transit bus, articulated bus, electric
trolleybus, CNG powered bus, hybrid electric bus, or any combination.&nbsp;
Doors would likely open automatically and boarding would be pre-paid.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40"><font face="Arial"><b><a href="Schedule.pdf">Service</a>
- </b></font>Would likely operate at 10-minute intervals at rush hour,
15-minutes on weekends and non-peak hours.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40"><b><font face="Arial"><a href="Capitol.htm">Detail of
Capitol Square</a> - </font></b>This proposal includes expanding Madison's
downtown car-free network to include the capitol square.&nbsp; The white lane
dividers are painted yellow, indicating <a href="CapitolDetail.htm"> 2-way
traffic</a>.&nbsp; Only bus lines, bicycles, and special vehicles like delivery
trucks and state employees (who park on the square) are allowed, similar to
State Street.&nbsp; Traffic signals are removed to improve
the flow of buses.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40"><b><font face="Arial"><a href="Lanes.htm">Rapid Transit Features</a> - </font></b>Include
signal preemption, limited stops, transit only lanes along much of the line, and
ticket vending and level boarding at stations.&nbsp; Separate guided transit ways are not
included.&nbsp; When we're ready to make that kind of investment, we'll upgrade
to light rail.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40"><b><font face="Arial">Capital Cost - </font></b>12
buses, 2 park and rides, 40 major stations, 16 minor stations, pavement
marking, signal priority, vending machines and card readers, maintenance
facility expansion.&nbsp; Milwaukee has a similar proposal called the <a href="http://www.mkedcd.org/ebulletin/transit/">COMET</a>
that is $55 million for two lines.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40"><b><font face="Arial">Schedule - </font></b> This proposal is not being considered
seriously by anyone at this time.&nbsp; If you'd like to see it happen, please <a href="mailto:mcechvala@gmail.com">e-mail me</a>

<p style="margin-left: 40"><font face="Arial" size="5" color="#800000">Why bus rapid transit?</font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40"><font face="Arial">There has been a lot of talk about different forms of
transit for Madison, especially rail.&nbsp; The argument is, basically, that
people like trains, and if you want to get people on transit, give them
trains.&nbsp; Arguably, that's not 100% right.&nbsp; What people like is
good service.&nbsp; They equate good service to rail because just about any rail
transit system is going to have good service.&nbsp; The reason is that rail is
expensive, so if you're a big city like Chicago or New York, you can afford to
build the rail system and stock it heavily with trains.&nbsp; So, specific
technology does not attract the most users, the service does.&nbsp; Financially, rail
starts making sense as the capacity of the system gets large since you can run
multiple cars with only one driver, the most expensive part of the vehicle.</font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40"><font face="Arial">Because of Madison's relatively small size, the critical
element is the minimum level of service.&nbsp; That is, we won't be writing
timetables based on the capacity requirements, we'll be writing them to provide
a reasonable amount of service.&nbsp; For rapid transit, 10 to 15 minute service
is really the minimum for a system to be truly rapid
transit.&nbsp; Longer headways mean people need to plan their trips with
schedules, which most choice riders are reluctant to do, and waiting that long
for a vehicle makes the trip less than &quot;rapid&quot;.&nbsp; At 10 minute
service, we don't need the high capacity of light rail yet, and that's why the
studies have shown it to be cost prohibitive.</font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40"><font face="Arial">So, in Madison, bus rapid transit gives us the most
service for our money, and service is what attracts riders.&nbsp; These
maps were drawn connecting the naturally occurring corridors in Madison with the
idea that they may connect to Verona, Sun Prairie, Middleton, and other towns
with limited service as the lines are extended.&nbsp; With rapid
transit, people will realize that they can quickly and conveniently get from one
point on a corridor to another, something conventional buses don't allow.&nbsp;
Madison could start a system like this with the red line, and gradually add
other lines that connect.&nbsp; In time, ridership will grow, and when
bus rapid transit can't keep up with demand, we can upgrade to light rail.&nbsp;
The BRT line(s) will help bring up that demand when people find they can expect
convenient travel on transit in Madison.&nbsp; Buses could be electric with overhead wires (called trolleybuses),
will benefit from signal priority like a train, and could feature things like
automated ticket vending for convenience and speed.&nbsp; The most speed is
attained from having limited stops like light rail and operating in bus only
lanes over most or all of the routes.</font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40"><font face="Arial">This is getting to be a fairly
&quot;normal&quot; process for upgrading transit in cities
around the world, and many cities in the United States.&nbsp; Bus rapid transit can come to Madison
soon, we are eligible for federal funding and there are fewer hurdles than
with LRT.&nbsp; BRT can also work very well with the proposed <a href="http://www.ci.madison.wi.us/streetcar/">Streetcar</a>
and <a href="http://www.transport2020.net/">Transport 2020</a> Commuter Rail
proposals.&nbsp; Here are some exciting examples of new bus rapid transit lines.</font></p>
