<h2>Madison Is Making Bad Bus Decisions That Make Little Sense</h2>
<h4><strong>Capital Times Editorial<br/>
Aug. 6, 2005<br/>
By Kathy Sands, Madison</strong></h4>

<p>Dear Editor: As a resident of Madison for more than 40 years, I have to say that this is the first time that I have ever been this upset with the city for allowing such an incredible increase in the cost of services. I have wondered for years why Madison Metro must drive around huge 66-passenger buses with normally one or two people on board most of the time.</p>

<p>I have been to other cities that are smart enough to use smaller buses because ridership has fallen over the years. Not Madison! We continue to use the gas-guzzling bus and complain about how it's costing so much more to pay for gas. Maybe someone should take a look at purchasing smaller buses to match the usual small ridership.</p>

<p>As citizens we are being told to buy smaller, more economical cars, to conserve on gas -- even buy hybrid electric cars if we're able. Yet, Madison has chosen to continue to use the gas-guzzling huge buses that are only filled during the school year when students are being transported back and forth.</p>

<p>Yes, I would like to know what they were thinking when they figured they should jack up the bus pass fare for students who are already footing the bill. This may not hurt the rich (they have the money) but as always, it is squeeeeezzzzing the middle class.</p>

<p>I guess it's kind of like when they chose to take driver education out of the school system and made us go through a private company for a cost of $375. We can never win in the city of Madison as a middle-class family.</p>

<p>I have now decided that I will do everything in my power to drive my kids to school because it's cheaper to pay $2.40 a gallon a gas at 24 miles per gallon than it is to pay the ungodly increase in youth bus passes. I think more parents will opt to do this if possible.</p>

<p>Yes, this will cause less ridership and a decrease in revenue, but I don't think anyone who made this decision is looking at the BIG picture. All they said is it is a short-term solution with more increases on the way later (now that made me feel real good!). East Washington Avenue will be an even worse nightmare than it already is due to more cars, but I don't care. It appears the city doesn't care either, so why should the people of Madison?</p>
