<h2>Citizens speak for Metro line</h2>
<h4><strong>by Darryl Schnell<br/>
Badger Herald<br/>
Wed., Nov. 9, 2005</strong></h4>

<p>Finishing up an early night, the Madison Common Council eased through a fairly short agenda Tuesday.</p>

<p>The council heard appeals from citizens to fully fund the Madison Metro Transit system this year, and approved a relocation for Paisan's restaurant.</p>

<p>During public hearings, a number of Madisonians spoke in favor of amending Mayor Dave Cieslewicz's 2006 Executive Operating Budget $557,000 cut in metro funding.</p>

<p>Currently, Ald. Ken Golden, District 10, has proposed a budget amendment to restore the money to Metro so the 2006 city funding matches the previous year's funding.</p>

<p>"The budget cuts the mayor made to Madison Metro are significant," Michael Barrett, member of the Urban Design Commission, said. "The cuts will reduce Metro ridership significantly."</p>

<p>Barrett said cutting funds for Metro would also significantly decrease the quality and quantity of service.</p>

<p>"Metro has said they will have to cut routes from the schedule and run some routes every hour rather than half hour," Barrett said. "This cut will mean far less weekend and holiday service as well."</p>

<p>Susan De Vos, member of the Transit and Parking Committee, said she thought she would be arguing for an expansion of funding rather than a restoration of funding for Metro.</p>

<p>"I never dreamed I would be here speaking for council to only provide what the mayor has taken away," De Vos said. "I thought the mayor was for Metro, especially with his clean air resolution, but it seems he says one thing and does the other."</p>

<p>Citizens acknowledged both environmental factors and public safety factors when speaking of the benefits of Madison Metro.</p>

<p>"Metro helps us deal with air-quality problems and global-warming issues," Barrett said. "It also reduces congestion on our streets, making them safer, especially for children and the elderly."</p>

<p>De Vos said a progressive city like Madison should be encouraging public transportation instead of more cars.</p>

<p>"I want to live to see the day when Madison citizens can live their lives in households dependent on only one or even no motor vehicles," De Vos said. "Cutting Metro funding would be taking a step in the wrong direction."</p>

<p>The council will approve the budget, along with any amendments, at the next council meeting Nov. 15.</p>

<p>Of concern to students, alders approved the relocation of Paisan's restaurant from University Square to a new home at 131 W. Wilson St.</p>

<p>Ald. Mike Verveer, District 4, made amendments to the transfer requiring all outdoor amplification and seating to cease Sunday through Thursday at 10 p.m. and Saturday and Sunday morning at midnight.</p>

<p>Rosemary Lee, a citizen in District 4, where Paisan's is set to move, said she was in favor of the approval of the transfer, but added she is slightly concerned about her health.</p>

<p>"With no opposition around, I don't feel like I have to speak in favor of the transfer," Lee said. "I'm just concerned I'm going to gain weight with Paisan's moving only 100 feet away from me."</p>
