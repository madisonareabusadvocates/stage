<h2>Getting fairer with fares</h2>
<h4><strong>Isthmus, December 4, 2008 Vikki Kratz</strong></h4>



<p>Housing advocates are pushing the city of Madison to create a new "low-income" cash fare for Metro riders.</p>

<p>
"We offer seniors a discount because they're low-income and on a fixed budget," says Lisa Subeck, a program coordinator for the YWCA. "So why not offer the same discount to individuals and families living at the same income levels?"
<p>Cash fares for Madison Metro are currently $1.50; next Tuesday, Dec. 9, the Transit and Parking Commission will decide whether to raise that fare to $2. Under Subeck's proposal, low-income individuals who are eligible for food stamps would pay $1.25. They would just have to show a food stamp eligibility card.</p>

<p>
Subeck says Metro's own ridership survey in 2000 found that 31% of riders who use cash fares have incomes below $15,000: "It's clear low-income riders are the most affected by increases to the cash fare."
<p>Members of the city's Transit and Parking Commission are interested in Subeck's proposal. "I like it a lot," says Ald. Brian Solomon, one of three alders on the commission. "Personally, I would love to see a low-income fare, no matter what."</p>

<p>
But since Metro projects a $682,000 budget gap next year, Solomon says the commission must be careful not to structure fares in a way that loses revenue. Subeck's proposal, he notes, only works if the commission raises cash fares for everyone else  something he's not sure should be done.
<p>"I'm still scared about those people who said this increase is going to price them out of Metro," he says, noting those who ride Metro by choice might defect to their cars. "If Metro is seen as only for low-income riders, I think public support starts eroding."</p>

<p>
Solomon sees other ways Metro can give a break to low-income individuals, such as expanding Transit for Jobs, which provides free bus rides for people looking for work. He also wonders if the city could contract with a nonprofit agency to provide discounted rides, like it does with major employers like the UW.
<p>Doing so might even increase revenue "because we might have nonprofits that think $1.50 is too much to pay, but 95 cents is enticing."</p>

<p>
Carl DuRocher, chair of the Transit and Parking Commission, agrees Subeck's plan is feasible. But "I don't want to do anything that makes the fare structure more complex. The easiest thing would be to not raise fares."
<p>
Subeck thinks the city will eventually have to raise fares. And she wants low-income riders to be protected from those increases. "If we create a new classification of fares for low-income, it sets up a more fair system in the future," she says. "This puts low-income riders in a better place to start."
