Madison bus riders now face route cutbacks as a result of this week's decision by the city Transit and Parking Commission to reject a proposed 50-cent fare hike.
<p>
And that's not the only consequence.
<p>
Planned service improvements will be scuttled, a proposed discount fare for low-income riders will likely be withdrawn, and Metro Transit will be in a weaker position to meet future demands.
<p>
That's why the City Council should override the commission's decision and approve the 50-cent fare increase proposed by Mayor Dave Cieslewicz.
<p>
No one is happy about raising the cash bus fare to $2 and hiking multi-ride and discount passes by corresponding amounts. But the increase is absolutely warranted to cover increased costs and give Metro Transit the resources it needs to maintain safe, effective service.
<p>
Furthermore, it's bus riders' turn to pitch in for the rising cost of the service they use. The adult cash fare has not increased since 2000. Meanwhile, taxpayers have increased their aid to Metro Transit by 70 percent.
<p>
In fact, city taxpayers pay more for Metro than riders pay -- by a $9.7 million to $9.1 million margin.
<p>
The mayor proposed the 50-cent increase after thoughtful deliberation with Metro staff over the best solution to a financial squeeze. The City Council approved the increase as part of the city budget.
<p>
But last month the Transit and Parking Commission, which has authority over fares, said no.
<p>
The mayor responded by revising the plan to include a discount fare that would lower the cost of a monthly pass to $27.50, from $48, for 3,600 low-income riders.
<p>
On Tuesday the commission took up the fare increase again. The commission again rejected the 50-cent hike, but this time it endorsed a 25-cent increase.
<p>
Commission members called their decision a compromise. But it was nothing more than a fiscally irresponsible decision to shortchange Metro and its riders.
<p>
The commission's vote leaves Metro with a projected $354,000 deficit -- and no option to cover the shortfall other than to make cutbacks that harm riders and risk sending Metro into a downward spiral.
<p>
A 50-cent bus fare increase is regrettable. But with a discount plan to protect low-income riders, it is the option that best resolves the looming budget deficit.
<p>
The Transit and Parking Commission's vote should be appealed to the City Council. The council should respond by approving the fare increase.<br>
