<h2>Mayor misguided on bus fare increases</h2>
<h4><strong>The Capital Times, February 3, 2009</strong></h4>



<p>
Dear Editor: Why does Mayor Dave Cieslewicz hate transit so?</p>

<p>
Having courageously voted in December to reject Metro fare increases, the Transit and Parking Commission more recently ratified half the proposed increase, to a cash fare of $1.75. Still, the mayor wants to override the authority of the commission under state statutes to establish transit fares.
</p>

<p>
Fare increases create a downward spiral. Increased fares lead to reduced ridership, leading to reduced revenue, leading to the ultimate decline of transit service.</p>

<p>
Mayor Dave's petulance in demanding a fare increase was compounded by his threat to replace members of the commission.
</p>

<p>
The mayor wants to discuss poverty instead of transportation policy. Transit is not a charity; it is a basic government service. A city survey lists Metro service as one of 15 core city services.</p>

<p>
The ample funding in the mayor's capital budget for commuter roads is a charity. Wealthy homeowners who fled to the outskirts of the city travel each day to work on roadways paid for with tax dollars, paying not a penny in user fees.
</p>

<p>
The proposal for a new security force to protect Metro riders is troubling. Madison's Police Department protects our citizens and visitors -- be they transit riders or otherwise. Thirty additional police officers were added in the previous budget.</p>

<p>
The Streets Department will keep plowing if the snow keeps falling, regardless of its budget. So too Madison Metro should keep running buses. Let the mayor and the City Council worry about funding.
</p>

<p>
The mayor's attitude is "it's my way or the highway -- and lots of them!"</p>
