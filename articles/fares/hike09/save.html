Dear Editor: 
<p>
Madison Metro would profit greatly by a courageous, informed position on Mayor Dave Cieslewicz's part to seriously strengthen and improve Metro's services, to position it for peak oil, to make it a transit system Madison could be proud of.
<p>
He's got to do something to save Metro from the death of a thousand cuts that's still being inflicted on it.
<p>
The sure-fire way to increase transit revenue is to raise ridership.
<p>
The sure-fire way to reduce ridership is to raise fares.
<p>
And a fare increase still, abidingly, would worst hurt those who can least afford it and who depend on Metro most. It's an issue of justice, such that motivated Martin Luther King Jr, Medgar Evers, Nelson Mandela, and Desmond Tutu.
<p>
There's been glib talk about "those who can afford to pay more," but even "choice" riders are saying that with $2 fares they'd have to reconsider whether to continue to Metro.
<p>
Mayor Dave must do better. Think big. Be brave.
<p>
Wouldn't it be great to be thought of and remembered as one of the great mayors of Madison? Doesn't he want to be admired and respected as a man of forethought and principle, a mayor for all the people, not just those who can line his pockets?
<p>
Ted Voth Jr., Madison
