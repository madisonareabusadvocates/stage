<h2>Bus fare hike is a wrong turn</h2>
<h4><strong>The Capital Times, December 08, 2009 An Editorial</strong></h4>



<p>In a recessionary moment, government takes on the role of the physician. The first responsibility is to do no harm.</p>

<p>
Unfortunately, Madison officials seem to have forgotten that. And they run the risk of making a move that will be doubly damaging &#0151; first, to the city's most economically vulnerable citizens and, second, to mass transportation.
<p>In a brutal and wrongheaded move, Mayor Dave Cieslewicz and his allies on the City Council are seeking to lay the burdens of hard times at the doorstep of the poor and working families. At the same time, they could irreparably harm an essential public service.</p>

<p>
How? By dramatically increasing Madison Metro fares.
<p>If the mayor and his allies get their way, bus fares will rise by 33 percent.</p>

<p>
The problem with this response to a bus system revenue shortfall, says Linda Ketcham, executive director of Madison-area Urban Ministries, is that it <q>balances Metro's budget on the backs of people who can least afford it and need (mass transportation) the most.</q>
<p>Ketcham's not alone in objecting.</p>

<p>
But, so far, the mayor and City Council majority have refused to seriously entertain alternatives to the hike.
<p>Concerned about a genuine but manageable revenue shortfall, they have panicked and adopted a rigid position that the only alternative to serious service cuts is a fare increase of 50 cents &#0151; putting a $2 price tag on even a short ride on a Madison bus.</p>

<p>
That's a higher fare than in most other cities Madison's size. In fact, it's comparable to fares in major metropolitan areas with substantially higher wages and greater transportation options.
<p>The fare increase is a wrong turn for Madison.</p>

<p>
It would strike a major blow to the city's bus system, dramatically slowing growth in ridership rates at precisely the time when -- for economic and environmental reasons -- the system should be expanding.
<p>Who says? Madison Metro.</p>

<p>
Chuck Kamp, the bus system's general manager, says that if fares stay the same &#0151;$1.50 a ride &#0151; ridership would increase about 5 percent to 14.1 million next year.
<p>If the cash fare increases to $2 and corresponding increases in the overall fare structure are implemented, Kamp says, ridership would increase only 1 percent to 13.5 million.</p>

<p>
Who won't be riding?
<p>Most of the drop-off will be among so-called "choice" riders, who will decide that a 33 percent increase in price makes waiting for the bus less attractive than driving. Thus, while forcing the working poor to pay more &#0151; since they have no alternative &#0151; the fare hike would drive middle&#0150;class riders away from the bus and put more cars on the road.</p>

<p>
The Madison Transit and Parking Commission has the authority to approve or disapprove the fare hike. Commissioners have a moral and practical responsibility to protect the bus system and its riders when they consider the proposal Tuesday. Unless a smart alternative is offered that protects low-income residents, maintains full service and keeps ridership levels up, the commission should reject the fare increase.
<p>
That would force the mayor and council either to approve service cuts &#0151; confirming their lack of commitment to mass transportation &#0151; or find the money needed to keep a good bus system on the road in tough times.
