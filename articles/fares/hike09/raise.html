<h2>Fare hike OK with driver, some riders</h2>
<h4><strong>Wisconsin State Journal, February 13, 2009</strong></h4>



<p>As a Metro Transit driver for 10 years and a 52-year North Sider, I've watched the debate over the bus fare increase.</p>

<p>
I and other drivers support Mayor Dave Cieslewicz and his increase. We haven't had an increase for awhile and it's needed to improve service and security on buses and at transfer points.
<p>Just recently another driver was hit while on duty and driving, only this time passengers held the offender until the police arrived. Who on the Transit and Parking Committee thinks this is all right?</p>

<p>
Drivers being struck, plus everything else they and the passengers go through, is eroding morale. I attend the TPC meetings every year for security and recovery time issues, only to be promised -- then ignored in the fall.
<p>Mayor Dave said low-income passengers will get the help they need through a discount pass. It seems to me there is a plan for the City Council after the fare increase.</p>

<p>
The bottom line is that, without an increase (which Milwaukee does every year), passengers will lose holiday and some Sunday service, drivers will still be abused and glued to their seats, waiting for long-run recovery time.
<p>Keep up the good work, Mayor Dave. There are many drivers and passengers who favor the fare increase.</p>
