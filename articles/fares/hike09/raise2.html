<h2>Metro Transit ridership hits 30-year high; some fear effect of fare increase</h2>
<h4><strong>Wisconsin State Journal, February 11, 2009<br/>
By DEAN MOSIMAN</strong></h4>

<p>Metro Transit is reporting a 30-year peak in bus ridership, but some fear a looming fare increase might undermine that trend.</p>

<p>Metro saw a 6 percent increase to 13,433,149 riders in 2008 – the second highest increase ever – and revenues rose $500,000 to $9.5 million, Metro officials said.</p>

<p>The 761,000-rider increase is due mainly to the growing popularity of an unlimited ride pass program involving the city, local colleges and hospitals, and the combination of spiraling gas prices early last year and the bad economy later in 2008, officials said.</p>

<p>A growing green movement and better technology like text and e-mail alerts to support riders also helped, they said.</p>

<p>"People really started getting on the bus," Metro spokesman Mick Rusch said. "We're excited they're riding."</p>

<p>But on Feb. 24, the City Council will decide whether to raise cash bus fares from $1.50 to either $1.75 or $2 and make related increases for passes and ticket packages.</p>

<p>A $2 fare pushed by Mayor Dave Cieslewicz to improve service and balance Metro's budget is expected to deflate a project ridership increase for this year from about 6 percent – which would push ridership to an all-time record – to 1 percent.</p>

<p>"I would like to see a 6 percent increase every year," said Ald. and Transit and Parking Commission member Robbie Webber, 5th District. "I don't want to do anything that's going to work against that increase."</p>

<p>Mayoral spokewoman Rachel Strauch-Nelson said even with the fare increase, ridership would still increase; without it, Metro would need to make major cuts. The increase would ensure the long-term health of Metro, so ridership can continue to grow in the future, Strauch-Nelson said.</p>

<p>Last fall, Cieslewicz and a 12-8 council majority included revenues from a $2 fare and related increases in the 2009 budget to boost service and marketing, add security, and cover shortfalls.</p>

<p>But the TPC, which sets fares, in December voted 7-2 against an increase over concern about loss of ridership and impact on low-income people. At the mayor's urging, the TPC reconsidered last month, voting 5-4 for a compromise, raising the fare to $1.75.</p>

<p>But a citizen appealed and the council is expected to make a decision on Feb. 24.</p>

<p>Metro's ridership has risen 33 percent since the city changed from a Downtown hub to a transfer-station system in mid-1998. After the change, schedules were cryptic, some riders saw longer commuting times, the budget exploded, and ridership initially dropped.</p>

<p>But ridership has increased every year since 2001.</p>
