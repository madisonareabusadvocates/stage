<h2>RTA must include outlying communities</h2>

I agree that raising Madison Metro bus fares is bad timing. But listening to many excellent speakers at last week's Madison City Council hearing demonstrated what a complicated set of circumstances the council is attempting to deal with in this economy.
</p><p>
The issue needs to mesh with regional transit authority concerns, and live up to the title "regional." Don't leave outlying towns and villages out of the discussion. Did the city of Madison invite outlying area representatives into Metro Transit's bus fare debates?
</p><p>
One speaker suggested raising fees for advertising on the buses for more revenue, especially now. Some Madison nonprofits may now wish to pay for bus signs with social justice concerns at any price, thanks to the Madison City Council.
