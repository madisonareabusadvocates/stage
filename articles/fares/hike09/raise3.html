<h2>Approve 50-cent bus fare hike for Madison Metro Transit</h2>
<h4><strong>Wisconsin State Journal, February 19, 2009 A Wisconsin State Journal editorial</strong></h4>



<p>The City Council on Tuesday should raise Madison's bus fare by 50 cents.</p>

<p>
The fare hike is absolutely warranted to cover increased costs and give Metro Transit the resources to maintain safe, effective service.
<p>
The alternative -- to save money by cutting service and forgoing improvements -- would harm riders far more than the fare increase.
< p>
Furthermore, the increase, which would raise the cash fare to $2 and similarly hike passes and ticket packages, would be cushioned by a discount for low-income riders.
<p>To raise the fare by 50 cents, the council must override the decision by the city Transit and Parking Commission, which approved only a 25-cent increase.</p>

<p>
In favoring the smaller fare hike, the commission opposed the recommendations of Mayor Dave Cieslewicz and Metro officials for a 50-cent increase.
<p>The commission's majority argued that the higher rate increase would cost the bus system ridership.</p>

<p>
Indeed, with a 50-cent rate increase, Metro's growth rate is projected to decline to 1 percent next year, down from 6 percent this year.
<p>But the 50-cent rate increase would improve prospects for long-term growth by allowing enhancements to service and security. In addition, Metro would bolster the marketing of unlimited ride passes to businesses, which were a prime factor in boosting ridership last year.</p>

<p>
In contrast, with only a 25-cent rate increase, Metro would be left with a $354,000 deficit, making it necessary to cut service and neglect improvements.
<p>The results of the smaller rate increase would pose a risk of ridership losses and leave Metro without the resources needed to resume growth in the future.</p>

<p>
The mayor even responded to concern about the impact of a fare increase on low-income riders by creating a discount fare that would make available 400 half-price passes a month to qualified riders.
<p>A 50-cent fare increase is justified. Metro's cash fare has not increased since 2000. Meanwhile, taxpayers have increased their aid to Metro by 70 percent.</p>

<p>
City taxpayers now pay more for Metro than riders pay -- by a $9.7 million to $9.1 million margin.
<p>To limit the raise to only 25 cents would shortchange not only Metro but also its riders.</p>

<p>
The City Council should approve the 50-cent hike proposed by the mayor.<br>
