Madison's Transit and Parking Commission won't again reconsider its refusal to raise Metro Transit cash bus fares to $2, Chairman Carl Durocher said Tuesday.
<p>
Instead, the TPC will stick to its decision to raise fares 25 cents to $1.75 and let the City Council hear a citizen's appeal on Feb. 24.
<p>
"It doesn't make any sense to keep on voting on this over and over," Durocher said.
<p>
Mayor Dave Cieslewicz wanted the TPC to reconsider.
<p>
Cieslewicz and a council majority included revenues from a $2 fare and related increases in the 2009 budget to boost service and marketing, add security, and cover shortfalls.
<p>
But the TPC, which sets fares, in December voted 7-2 against an increase over concern about loss of ridership and impact on low-income people.
<p>
At the mayor's urging, the TPC reconsidered last month, voting 5-4 for a compromise, raising the fare to $1.75.
<p>
Cieslewicz last week asked Durocher to put a reconsideration on TPC's Tuesday agenda.
<p>
But neither the mayor nor a TPC member who voted with the majority made a formal request, so it won't happen, Durocher said.
<p>
"The City Council will have to look at all the affected people in the face when they come to testify," he said.<br>
