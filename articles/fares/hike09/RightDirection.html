<h2>Mayor's moving in right direction in bus fare debate</h2>
<h4><strong>The Capital Times, January 10, 2009 An Editorial</strong></h4>



<p>
In the debate over raising Madison Metro fares, Mayor Dave Cieslewicz's new proposal to protect low-income bus riders is commendable.</p>

<p>
The city's Transit and Parking Commission on Tuesday will reconsider its 7-2 vote against implementing the mayor's proposed 50-cent per ride increase, which was rejected in large part because of criticism that a fare hike would hurt low-income riders who depend on Madison Metro for transportation.
</p>

<p>
On Friday the mayor called for providing reduced-price monthly passes to low-income riders. His plan is based on a proposal advanced by veteran community services advocate Lisa Subeck.</p>

<p>
The plan would use $100,000 from Madison Metro's  backup fund to make 400 passes per month available to low-income riders in 2009. The passes would cut the proposed cost of an adult monthly pass in half, from $55 to $27.50. The mayor also said that if the increase was passed, he would create a special committee to look at a long-term plan for providing fares to low-income riders.
</p>

<p>
The mayor is to be applauded for his recognition that the low-income Madisonians for whom Metro is a necessity should not bear the burden of Metro's financial problems in these hard economic times.</p>

<p>
The mayor should continue his efforts to compromise with those who opposed his original plan to increase Metro's fares. Specifically, he should work to find common ground with Ald. Brian Solomon, District 10, who has been the most outspoken critic of the mayor's proposed increase.
</p>

<p>
Both Cieslewicz and Solomon are committed supporters of the bus system.</p>

<p>
In addition to working out a plan for fare relief for low-income Madisonians, they could look for some areas of agreement on how the city might use infusions of federal funding -- which are likely to come as part of Obama administration stimulus packages -- to enhance both the viability and the affordability of Metro.
</p>

<p>
The bottom line is that there is room to negotiate, and that negotiation should take place before Tuesday's meeting of the Transit and Parking Commission.</p>

<p>
Solomon and the members of the commission were right to challenge the rush to implement a fare hike.
</p>

<p>
But the mayor is right that Metro needs a sounder fare structure.</p>

<p>
Instead of fighting, both sides should recognize their shared values and the potential for a compromise.
</p>

<p>
For this to happen, Cieslewicz should take the lead. He made a good start Friday with his proposal to help low-income riders.<br>
