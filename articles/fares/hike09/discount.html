<h2>Discount bus passes proposed</h2>
<h4><strong>Wisconsin State Journal, January 10, 2009 Devin Rose</strong></h4>



<p>Mayor Dave Cieslewicz presented a plan Friday that would allow low-income Metro Transit riders to buy discounted monthly passes  an effort to keep ridership up in the event a fare increase takes effect April 1.</p>

<p>
With the help of nonprofit organizations, the proposal would make 3,600 passes available to people eligible for food stamps for $27.50 instead of the proposed $55 on a first-come, first-served basis.
<p>Metro would tap $100,000 from a contingency fund to pay for the discounts.</p>

<p>
"By implementing both the fare increase and a low-income rider proposal, we can improve the Metro system and the service it provides, while working to make sure those who need it most have access to it," Cieslewicz said in a statement.
<p>This proposal comes a month after members of the Transit and Parking Commission, which is responsible for setting Metro fares, voted 7-2 against an increase that would raise the fare to $2 up from $1.50.</p>

<p>
Most members said an increase would jeopardize growth by alienating low-income riders.
<p>"Studies show that, demographically, people who ride Metro are two times as likely to be at or near the poverty line than the population as a whole," said TPC Chairman Carl Durocher.</p>

<p>
It is yet to be determined whether the fare increase will take effect, and TPC members will continue deliberation at their meeting Tuesday.
<p>Considering this new plan, Durocher said he thought many people not on food stamps still would find the increased price a "real obstacle."</p>

<p>
"If we're trying to use the money from the fare hike to reduce impact on the poor end of ridership," he said, "then wouldn't we be able to do that by not raising fares in the first place?"
<p>Durocher added that the city already has similar programs to help low-income riders.</p>

<p>
The mayor also hopes to create a committee that will develop a more sustainable program by Aug. 1 for consideration in the 2010 budget, assuming the fare increase is enacted.<br>
