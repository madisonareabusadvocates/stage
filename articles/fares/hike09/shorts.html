<h2>Short Opinions from the Wisconsin State Journal</h2>
<h4><strong>Wisconsin State Journal, January 15, 2009</strong></h4>



<p>


<b>Bus fare increase a reasonable move</b>
<p>I don't think it's unreasonable for Metro Transit to ask for a fare increase. Perhaps raising the fare and cutting some services would be helpful. Every major city has had to raise bus fares to keep services going.</p>

<p>
Of course it will affect low-income people. However, large cities with higher populations of low-income people have had to raise fares and people have had to adjust to those changes.
<p>Another concern of the Transit and Parking Commission is that Metro Transit will lose ridership. I don't see this happening. Though the price of gas is down, the bad economy has forced people to take cost cutting measures.</p>

<p>
Cutting holiday and Sunday service will impact riders more than a 50-cent fare increase. Using cab services to get to work will cost low-income riders much more than a 50-cent bus fare increase.

<p>
<b>Car owners should subsidize bus use</b>
<p>I suggest that the city assess a fee of $5 to $10 when issuing car tags and stickers to cover the cost of maintaining the Metro bus service.</p>

<p>
There should be subsidization of buses by those who wish to drive rather than use public transport. (Full disclosure: I ride the bus perhaps once a year.)

<p>
<b>Think creatively -- let buses be city service</b>
<p>Let's re-frame the Madison bus fare question. I propose that Madison buses have no bus fare at all, or one simple small fare for all, perhaps 50 cents a ride.</p>

<p>
Stop seeing Metro Transit as a city-run business that should at least pay for itself. Instead, view it as a public utility like streets, garbage pickup and so on, supported mainly by taxes paid by all. No public transportation system in the world breaks even.
<p>We'd all save with reduced congestion, improved air quality, added convenience, fewer parking facilities, access to transportation for all, reduced dependence on foreign oil, fewer roads and parking garages constructed, etc.</p>

<p>
By not collecting fares, there'd be no overhead for printing tickets and transfers, no complex collection machines, no accounting department, few marketing costs.
<p>Wrap all the buses with ads for income (but don't cover the windows) and extend lines to the outlying suburbs with a modest charge for suburban service. Use part of the city parking revenue for the bus budget and find other ways to make private cars share in the costs. Think creatively.</p>
