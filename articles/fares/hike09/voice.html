<h2>Residents voice pros, cons of Metro fare increase</h2>

Nearly 100 people came to the Transit and Parking Commission meeting Monday night to give their thoughts on a proposed Madison Metro bus fare increase, with opinions ranging from outright opposition to those favoring a fare increase over service cuts.
<p>
The commission will face a decision on raising bus fares at its Dec. 9 meeting after Madison's City Council voted this month to pass on a deficit of more than $600,0000 in the Madison Metro budget. Under the model originally suggested by Metro manager Chuck Kamp, cash fares would increase 50 cents and other fares would increase proportionally, most by 20 to 30 percent.
<p>
Several attendees asked the commission to seek a new model that would help low-income riders, who could be disproportionately affected by a fare increase. Lisa Subeck of the YWCA suggested introducing a low-income fare similar to the senior and disabled cash fare, currently set at 75 cents and proposed to increase to $1. According to data from a 2000 rider survey, Subeck said more than 50 percent of Metro riders have household incomes under $25,000, with 31 percent of families using the cash-fare option having incomes below $15,000, making retaining low-income ridership a priority.
<p>
"We all love older people, we all love disabled people, but the reality is, we don't charge them a lower fare because we love them," she said. "We charge them a lower fare because we know that they can't afford the same fares as some of our higher-income folks. I'm asking that you do the same for all low-income people."
<p>
A few speakers at the meeting supported a fare increase because of the potential for the budget deficit to lead to service cuts, which they said would be more damaging to Metro than a fare increase.
<p>
Michelle Beasley, a Madison resident who moved recently from Mesa, Ariz., said a reluctance to raise fares in Mesa led to massive weekend cuts and limited service, essentially crippling their transit system.
<p>
Gene Gowey of the Teamsters Local 695 Union also spoke in favor of the fare increase, arguing for the 387 Metro employees who could face job losses if the commission voted to cut service instead.
<p>
A large number of speakers expressed anger at the meeting about Metro's flaws as a system, however, arguing that any service perks to a fare increase would be temporary and would ultimately leave riders worse off. In the Mayor Dave Cieslewicz's plan, Metro would benefit from service improvements, increased security at transfer points, increased funding for the city's Transit for Jobs program and a new marketing position to promote unlimited ride passes.
<p>
"I've ridden the bus consistently since 1994. I don't drive, so this is my transportation around the city," said Leigh Derwin. "One of the things I've noticed, basically, is I pay more, which is OK because I understand rates go up, but I keep getting promised a better service, but I don't get better service."
<p>
Derwin cited examples of service declines, including changes to Route 13, which no longer takes riders directly to the Capitol, heaters at transfer points and bus stops that have been talked about since the 1980s, but never implemented, and a common refrain, that the transfer point system has significantly slowed travel by bus.
<p>
Others spoke out against any fare increase for environmental or economic reasons, particularly in a time when Dane County was recently reclassified for its poor air quality and when gas prices are going down, leading more riders to either choose to drive their current cars or to purchase cheap, environmentally damaging "junker" cars.
<p>
"The gas prices rose this summer and they'll rise again," said near-west side county board supervisor Al Matano. "With that rise in gas prices, we saw an increase in ridership. We as transit people got to know people who we had never reached before. It's a poor time to chase them away. Let's get to know them and make long-time friendships."
<p>
Matano also questioned whether a fare increase would jeopardize the long-term goals of mass transit in the region, particularly Transport 2020's attempts to bring state and federal funding to the greater Madison area for alternative transportation.
