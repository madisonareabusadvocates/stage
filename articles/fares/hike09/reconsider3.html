<h2>Final vote on bus fare hike may not be -- final</h2>
<h4><strong>Wisconsin State Journal, December 31, 2008<br/>
By DEAN MOSIMAN</strong></h4>

<p>Debate "is not over" on a Metro Transit bus fare increase, Madison Transit and Parking Commission Chairman Carl Durocher said Monday.</p>

<p>A new Metro staff analysis on the impacts on ridership, a coming outline of service cuts lacking an increase, and a proposal by Mayor Dave Cieslewicz to help the working poor continue riding make it likely the TPC will reconsider its recent decision against raising fares, Durocher said.</p>

<p>On Dec. 9, the TPC voted 7-2 to refuse to raise fares to balance Metro's budget in 2009.</p>

<p>Now, Durocher has put the increase on the TPC's Jan 13 agenda. "I'm not sure what's going to happen," he said.</p>

<p>New information includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>A Metro memo saying its projections on impacts are superior to an analysis offered by TPC member and Ald. Brian Solomon, which said an increase might hurt ridership more and produce less revenue.</li>
<li>Solomon's analysis, based on American Public Transit Association (APTA) research, influenced the TPC on Dec. 9.</li>
<li>A yet-to-be completed Metro listing of service cuts required lacking a fare increase.</li>
<li>A proposal from Cieslewicz on how to subsidize rides for the working poor.</li>
</ul>

<p>In the fall, Cieslewicz proposed raising Metro Transit cash fares 50 cents to $2 and making related increases for ticket packages and passes to raise at least $680,000 in nine months next year to improve service, add security at transfer points, boost marketing, build a reserve and cover shortfalls.</p>

<p>In November, the City Council voted 12-8 to support the proposal in the 2009 budget.</p>

<p>The TPC refused the increase over fears it would harm ridership and hurt low-income riders most. The mayor called the vote "irresponsible." TPC member Kevin Hoag, who voted against an increase, resigned.</p>

<p>Metro's projections show the increases would raise $838,000 in nine months next year and result in a 1 percent net increase in ridership.</p>

<p>The projections are more accurate than Solomon's analysis because Metro's model has evolved in recent years and is based on Madison experience, while the APTA model is 17 years old and doesn't factor nuances in the local market, Metro's memo says.</p>

<p>When the models are applied to Metro's 2005 increases, Metro's projections are closer.</p>

<p>Solomon, who was traveling and hadn't seen Metro's memo, was steadfast. "The fare increase is a bad idea for a number of reasons," he said.</p>

<p>An increase, he said, must be considered against the backdrop of lower gas prices and stable parking fees.</p>

<p>Cieslewicz said, "I'm not willing to change my mind on the fare increase. I'm very open to discussing ways to accomplish it."</p>
