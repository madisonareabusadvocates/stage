<h2>Memo outlines possible Metro Transit cuts</h2>
<h4><strong>Wisconsin State Journal, January 8, 2009 By DEAN MOSIMAN and CHRIS RICKERT</strong></h4>



<p>If the city doesn't increase bus fares, Metro Transit would have to reduce Sunday service and make other "significant" service cuts, a new memo says.</p>

<p>
Mayor Dave Cieslewicz has wanted a 50 cent cash fare increase to $2 and corresponding increases to balance Metro's budget for this year.
<p>But last month, the Transit and Parking Commission, which sets fares and service levels, voted 7-2 to refuse to do so, citing concerns about a loss of ridership and the impact on low-income people.</p>

<p>
Cieslewicz called the vote "irresponsible" and the TPC has agreed to his request to revisit its vote on Tuesday.
<p>
On Wednesday, Metro General Manager Chuck Kamp issued a two-page memo outlining service cuts that would be needed to cover a projected $762,000 budget gap absent a fare increase, including:
<ul>
    <li>Reducing Sunday service from 16 to eight hours, saving $440,000.</li>
    <li>Eliminating service on all major holidays, saving $175,000.</li>
    <li>Eliminating new service called for in the 2009 budget, saving $150,000.</li>
    <li>Cutting five bus drivers.</li>
 </ul>

"This is exactly the kind of stark choice that the City Council and I were facing when we put the city budget together," Cieslewicz said. "Now, confronted with that reality, my hope is that the TPC will see the fare increase as the better alternative to service cuts."
<p>Kamp, who in the memo recommends the TPC approve the fare increase, could not be reached for comment Wednesday afternoon.</p>

<p>
Members of the TPC who opposed the fare increase were cool to Kamp's recommendations.
<p>"I'm not 100 percent convinced that the services have to be slashed as much as management is currently proposing," TPC Chairman Carl Durocher said.</p>

<p>
Everyone agrees maintaining and building on ridership gains are a priority, he said, but both of the competing budget fixes  a fare increase or service cuts  hurt ridership. He suggested that reductions in the amount Metro spends on things like marketing and security, combined with changes to Metro's broader fare structure  which includes monthly and passes and youth fares  could lead to a compromise.
<p>"I think there are other places we can get money from other than through services reductions," said Ald. and TPC member Brian Solomon, 10th District. He said he is opposed to increases in any of Metro's fares.</p>

<p>
The service cuts outlined in Kamp's memo are one of three pieces of information the TPC will review on Tuesday.
<p>By the end of the week, Cieslewicz intends to propose a new effort to help the working poor continue riding.</p>

<p>
Earlier, Metro staff provided a memo saying its projections on the impacts of a fare increase are superior to an analysis offered by Solomon, which said an increase might hurt ridership more and produce less revenue.
<p>Solomon's analysis, based on American Public Transit Association research, influenced the TPC on Dec. 9.</p>

<p>
In the fall, Cieslewicz proposed raising Metro fares to raise at least $680,000 in nine months this year to improve service, add security at transfer points, boost marketing, build a reserve and cover shortfalls.
<p>
In November, the City Council voted 12-8 to support the proposal in the 2009 budget.<br>
