The last bus that pulls away from West Towne Mall each night may look almost empty, acknowledges Cynthia Travis, but for the employees who depend on it, it's crucial.
<p>
"Without that bus, you're paying $21 for a cab ride home," Travis, who leads the Tenant Advocacy Group, said Thursday. "That's three hours of work. Without buses, you aren't even breaking even."
<p>
Travis is among those urging the city not to reduce bus service in next year's budget. Currently, the allocation for Metro, despite being an increase, is expected to be roughly $500,000 short of what would be needed to keep all routes at their current schedules.
<p>
With 10 City Council members pledging to raise the tax levy by no more than 4.1 percent - the mark that city officials initially believed a state cap would impose - the local political party Progressive Dane is proposing three primary ways of offsetting the services that they'd like to add or maintain.
<p>
Ald. Brenda Konkel said Thursday that they would seek to pull $400,000 from the parking utility, which is self-financing and currently does not share its revenue from parking ramps with the city. Secondly, Konkel said that Progressive Dane is proposing a half-percent increase to the city's hotel room tax and, lastly, would like to increase the costs of building permits by 1 cent per square foot.
<p>
Under the budget amendment, the room tax increase would be allocated directly to the Overture Center, which would free up about $438,000 of the approximately $1.6 million that the city pays the arts district from its general fund. Additionally, Konkel said, the building permits would be expected to raise another $400,000.
<p>
"Metro is my biggest concern," Konkel said, but her party is also seeking to increase affordable housing funds and childcare services.
<p>
"The people who are getting hit hardest by the budget cuts are those who are least able to afford them," said Lisa Subeck, a Progessive Dane member who also represents the Affordable Housing Action Alliance.
<p>
"I do think it's important to keep taxes low," Konkel said, "but we can't afford to leave people behind by cutting back on core services."
<p>
Konkel said that with the proposed revenue increases, maintaining Metro service and furthering affordable housing and childcare issues would increase the 2006 budget by about $500,000, leaving the levy increase at about 4.3 percent.
<p>
That's below the 15-year-historical average, and below the state cap that actually poses a cap no tighter than 7 percent. But Konkel said it "will be close" to persuade the council to adopt the plan. Ten members, one vote short of an 11-member majority, have said that they would not increase the tax levy beyond 4.1 percent.
