<h3>Bus Fare Increase Is Wrongheaded</h3>
<strong>The Capital Times :: EDITORIAL :: 9A</strong><br/>
            08/09/2005
        <br/>
<em>by Michael Neuman, Madison</em>
<p>Dear Editor: The city and Madison Metro only looked at one side of
the equation in trying to remedy Metro's budget problems. Instead of
raising bus fares, they should have been assessing ways to increase
daily and monthly bus ridership.
</p><p>Raising fares is counterproductive to raising ridership and
will just make matters worse for Madison's bus riders, the city and
Madison Metro. They should have learned that from the last time they
raised the fares, two years ago.
</p><p>Metro's own projections show that increasing fares will reduce
the number of riders. Eventually, this will lead to reductions in the
number of bus routes as well, just like the last time. Mistakes have a
way of being repeated by those who don't learn from them the first
time.
</p><p>To keep fares affordable, Madison Metro should have instead
worked on expanding its service to communities outside of Madison.
Substantial increases in ridership could have been gained by making
transit available to people who now commute by auto to Madison
regularly.
</p><p>With the ever-increasing price of gasoline, now would be a good
time for officials in Dane County to initiate contact with one another
to get the buses rolling. This would lead to larger ridership numbers
and relieve Dane County's highways and air quality from the burden of
too much single-occupancy driving to Madison, while reducing the
pressure to increase bus fares again in Madison.
