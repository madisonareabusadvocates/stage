<h2>Panel rejects Madison bus fare increase</h2>

Defying the wishes of Mayor Dave Cieslewicz, Madison's Transit and Parking Commission refused to raise bus fares to balance Metro Transit's budget next year.
<p>
After a three-hour discussion, the TPC voted 7-2 on Tuesday against any fare increase and asked Metro staff to develop alternatives to close a projected revenue gap next year.
<p>
"We'll have to figure out how we do that," Metro Transit General Manager Chuck Kamp said after the vote. "We have an approved budget and an approved fare that are in conflict."
<p>
Cieslewicz proposed raising Metro Transit cash fares 50 cents to $2 and making related increases for ticket packages and passes to raise at least $680,000 in nine months next year to improve service, add security at transfer points, boost marketing, build a reserve and cover shortfalls.
<p>
The City Council last month voted 12-8 to support the proposal in the 2009 budget.
<p>
But the TPC has authority to set fares and service within the budget set by the council.
<p>
"The mayor is disappointed," spokeswoman Rachel Strauch-Nelson said. "If we don't go ahead with imposing a fare increase, we're looking at very severe service cuts."
<p>
Earlier, Cieslewicz had even threatened to not reappoint TPC members if the commission opposed the increase.
<p>
But from the start, many riders opposed the increase and TPC members voiced concern that a fare hike would hurt low-income families and curb ridership.
<p>
The debate, however, shifted dramatically on Tuesday night after TPC member and Ald. Brian Solomon, 10th District, offered an alternative analysis on the impact of a fare increase based on American Public Transit Association research.
<p>
The proposed fare increase, Solomon argued, might produce far less revenue than Metro staff had projected.
<p>
An increase, he said, might feed a vicious cycle of cutting service, raising fares and advertising revenue, and cutting service again.
<p>
"We have to give our customers much more than that," he said.
<p>
"The health of Metro depends on increasing ridership," chairman Carl Durocher said.
<p>
The failing economy and dropping gas prices make it the wrong time to raise fares, others said.
<p>
"I think we want to hold onto our seats and see what happens," TPC alternate member Margaret Bergamini said.
<p>
But some TPC members said the commission should trust staff projections and that the lack of new revenue would undermine what riders want most — improved service.
<p>
It's unclear how Metro would close a budget gap, but options include cutting service on seven holidays, reducing Sunday service and not filling the marketing position included in the 2009 budget, Kamp said.
<p>
But TPC members said savings could also be found in some Cieslewicz initiatives, including $150,000 for additional service, $100,000 for security at transfer stations, and $240,000 for the contingency fund.
<p>
Metro projections show the $2 cash fare and related increases would have raised $838,000 in nine months next year &#0151; $1 million annually &#0151; and result in a 1 percent increase in ridership to 13.5 million next year.
<p>
Ridership is projected to increase about 5 percent to 14 million without a fare increase.
