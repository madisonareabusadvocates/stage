<h2>City Work Can Bring Big Bucks</h2>
<h4>The Capital Times :: BUSINESS :: A10</h4>

<p>City work can bring big bucks. Call it a case of wealth envy, but few issues get the public worked up like public workers taking home a big paycheck.
<p>
And thanks to overtime pay, <b>bus drivers remain some of the top paid employees in the city of Madison</b>.
<p>
New figures show that 43 city employees made more than $100,000 in 2006, topped by comptroller Dean Brasser at $133,927. The numbers include base pay, overtime, sick leave payout or vacation payout at retirement.
<p>
City engineer Larry Nelson was the second highest paid city worker at $133,463. City attorney Michael May at $125,040 was third.
<p>
Not surprisingly, attorneys, fire fighters and police officers dominate the list of the city's "$100,000 Club." The <b>$100K Club also includes two bus drivers: John Nelson, the 18th best-paid city employee at $113,610 and Roger Waggoner No. 32 at $103,786.</b> Two other drivers were among the top 60 wage earners.
<p>
Mayor Dave Cieslewicz was 23rd on the list at $111,544.
<p>
The city has roughly 2,700 full-time employees with at least 700 earning more than $63,000 annually, according to figures circulated last week by local watchdog Mike Roach. (For a complete list, e-mail Roach at mikero9@charter.net).
<p>
Of the city's top paid 50 employees, seven are attorneys, 11 work in the fire department and 13 in the police department.
<p>
Fire chief Debra Amesqua was paid $112,673 last year but that figure was topped by three of her assistant chiefs: Michael Dirienzo ($117,340), Paul Bloom ($114,959) and James Keiken ($114,451).
<p>
Police chief Noble Wray was the city's top-paid cop at $121,349 followed by assistant chiefs Randall Graber ($117,772) and Charles Cole ($114,384).
<p>
<b>High pay for bus drivers became a big issue in the late 1990s when it was reported that four bus drivers were among the city's top 50 in earnings.
<p>
Drivers evolved into some of the city's highest earners immediately after Madison Metro changed from a Downtown hub to a transfer station system in mid-1998. The change left Metro short of drivers to cover new routes while contract provisions limited Metro's ability to use part-time drivers during commuter peaks and let senior drivers amass large amounts of overtime.
<p>
In fact, a bus driver was the city's pay leader in 1998 and 1999, and five drivers were among the top 25 earners in 1999.
<p>
Although many drivers still earn high wages, Metro has been more aggressive in filling vacancies and has gotten a better handle on overtime over the past two years, although the latest figures suggest drivers who pick up additional shifts can still earn big money.
<p>
Other top city salaries of note include outgoing Metro general manager Catherine Debo at $117,115</p></p></p></p></b>; embattled city water utility manager David Denig-Chakroff at $116,440 and city planning and development director Mark Olinger at $115,015.
<p>
Interim Overture Center director Michael Goldberg, who resigned after not getting the job permanently, was paid $102,999 last year.
