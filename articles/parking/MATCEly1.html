<h2>Parking plans stalled by cityCollege to continue effort for additional parking at Truax</h2>

<p>Parking plans stalled by city
         College to continue effort for additional parking at Truax
The Clarion,  January 27, 2010 
          Eric Ely</p>

<p>Madison Area Technical College's parking proposal, an integral part of the school's long-term Facilities Master Plan, was recently not approved by the city.</p>

<p>The proposal called for expanded parking at the Truax campus, with the lots to be located near the soccer fields across Anderson Street.</p>

<p>"The main reason is to provide more parking for students," said Roger Price, Vice President of Infrastructure. Price continued by saying the additional parking would reduce the risk of flooding, as experienced in parts of the lots earlier this year.</p>

<p>The new proposal would also improve safety for students. Currently the intersection of Hoffmann and Anderson streets is quite dangerous and making a left turn from Hoffmann street, especially during peak periods, is time-consuming and a hassle.</p>

<p>The proposed parking lot would also provide accessible parking for Madison College sporting events, something that is currently lacking.</p>

<p>"The plans haven't been turned down, they haven't been approved," Price said.</p>

<p>The proposal has already received urban development approval and has also been approved by local representatives and alderpersons.</p>

<p>The next step for Madison College, says Price, is to conduct follow-up talks with the city.</p>

<p>"We will produce a sustainability report," Price said. This report will highlight the parking problems at Truax in more detail. The college will also conduct an impact study to present to the city planning committee.</p>

<p>Funds for the project have already been authorized. Once final approval is gained for the project it will be implemented as soon as possible.</p>

<p>The beginning of the spring semester has seen another increase in enrollment at Madison College. This enrollment increase only multiplies the parking problems students face at the Truax campus.</p>

<p>Being a commuter campus, parking at Truax is of utmost importance to its students. As a result, problems arising from parking are magnified.</p>

<p>Price acknowledged the concerns of students and the parking issues that affect them. The college is aware of these problems and the parking proposal shows this awareness. Madison College is taking action to alleviate these problems, but for now students will have to do the best they can, working under the conditions of the current situation.</p>

<p>"More classes have been moved to other campuses," Price explained, "making things more convenient for students."</p>

<p>By having more courses taught at various campuses, students in certain programs have the ability to fulfill more of their degree requirements. For others, they may be able to find classes offered at a campus closer to their home or work, making the commute to school less troublesome.</p>

<p>Price also acknowledged the work of the student senate and the bus pass referendum that took place and was passed last year. He praised the students for their action, participation and for voicing their opinions in dealing with the problems that face both them and the college.</p>
