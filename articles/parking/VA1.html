<h2>New ramp at VA Hospital will ease parking woes for patients, employees</h2>
<h4><strong>By DOUG ERICKSON | derickson@madison.com<br/>
Wisconsin State Journal, November 29, 2011</strong></h4>

<p>For years, the parking squeeze at the Madison Veterans Hospital has given patients a bit of a headache.</p>
<p>Now, a five-level ramp with 826 parking spots is rectifying what had become an inconvenience for some veterans seeking treatment. Employees, too, had been burdened, with most needing to park off site and walk or bus in so that parking for patients could be the priority.</p>
<p>The $9.7 million ramp, the VA Hospital's only parking structure, is nearing completion and is expected to open Dec. 19. It will bring the total number of parking spaces at the VA to just more than 1,500, a net gain of about 600.</p>
<p>"It wouldn't take long before the lot was full and there was nowhere for people to park, and a lot of these people were old," said William Chitek, 75, of Lodi, an Army veteran.</p>
<p>He's pleased to see the ramp going up  "It's a beautiful structure"  in part because it will ease the commute for staff members. "Those are nothing but good people," he said.</p>
<p>The hospital is tightly packed on 19 acres, with no room for expanding outward, said Tim Donovan, community relations chief. All the while, the number of patients and employees has increased.</p>
<p>The hospital typically sees 800 or more people daily as outpatients, in addition to the nearly 90 inpatients. The facility employs about 1,500 people, Donovan said. More than 600 people volunteer their services.</p>
<p>"Parking has been tough here for at least the last 20 years," Donovan said. The VA had addressed the squeeze in various ways, such as leasing parking spaces for employees off site,</p>
<p>"We'd dealt with it incrementally over the years, but now we have what we hope is a more-permanent solution," he said.</p>
<p>The ramp is replacing a surface parking lot that once held a couple of hundred vehicles. During construction, the hospital greatly expanded its free valet service for patients.</p>
<p>The ramp will be free, too, but monitored so that only patients, employees, volunteers and official guests can use it, Donovan said. Money for the ramp was allocated by Congress through the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, he said.</p>
<p>Jo Ellen Zimmerman, a urology technician and 26-year VA employee, called the ramp greatly needed. "We've seen such a huge influx of vets because of the recent wars and the economy," she said.</p>
<p>She's heard patients mention they've lost private health insurance and are now tapping their veterans benefits, she said.</p>
<p>Robert Anderson, 72, of Whitewater, an Air Force veteran at the VA last week for a medical appointment, said he's still healthy enough to walk several blocks if need be. "But most of these fellows can't," he said. "And I suppose I'll be there myself one day."</p>
