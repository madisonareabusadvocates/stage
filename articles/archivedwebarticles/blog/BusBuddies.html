<p>One of the pleasant features of public transit is that it can provide riders a sense of community even as each passenger may be going to a different destination for a different reason. Some talk while others may simply acknowledge anothers presence with a nod, eye contact or some other form of nonverbal communication.</p>

<p>As a favorite bus poem goes (<i>Express Route Madison</i>):</p>
<blockquote><i>
This bus is bound for Community.<br /> Its around the next bend.<br /> Hop onboard.<br />Return your
drivers greeting.<br >Extend your smile across the aisle.<br />Lets move it.<br />Were all
in.</i>
<div align="center">Catherine Young</div></blockquote>

<p>Or another:</p>
<blockquote><i>
Blank faces,<br />
going places,<br /> Sharing space</i>
<div align="center">Kathryn Lederhause</div></blockquote>

<p>Passengers may discuss a favorite hobby or the latest news. They may commiserate about the weather or speak excitedly about a recent or upcoming event. Or they may just try to rest quietly, perhaps listening to a podcast with earphones and an ipod or smartphone. It is thus sobering indeed that many senior citizens, people with disabilities, and newcomers may suffer from a sense of isolation that can lead to serious health impairments, physical and/or mental.</p>

<p>They could, but do not, get out by riding the bus. They may find it too unfamiliar, too intimidating. But what if there were a bus buddy who would take the trip with them until they felt comfortable enough to do it on their own? That is the thinking behind RSVP (Retired and Senior Volunteer) of Dane Countys <a href="http://www.rsvpdane.org/bus-buddy" target="_blank">Bus Buddy program</a> and its volunteer coordinators.</p>

<p>As Jan Karst and Diana Jost explain: <i>The volunteer Coordinators meet with new passengers, teach riders about the bus system, routes, the bus stops nearest them, scheduling, transfers, accessibility (ramps, kneeling bus), and seating. They accompany the passengers on the first one or two trips and continue to accompany them until they are comfortable to ride on their own. The coordinators provide them with the training and confidence they need to be able to use this low-cost transportation.</i></p>

<p>In addition to one-on-one activity, there are free Bus Buddy Tours meant to combine learning to use the bus with a fun outing. Bus Buddy volunteers lead group tours that include instructions on how to use the bus, a visit to a local attraction and a complimentary lunch or snack (thanks to funding from Dane County Human Services and AAA). Now in its fourth year, there were five trips during the Spring and Summer of 2018: <b>1</b>. Olbrich Gardens (April 25); <b>2</b>. Madison Children's Museum (May 17); <b>3</b>. Wisconsin History Museum (June 19); <b>4</b>.
Vitense Golfland (July 18); and <b>5</b>. Chazen Museum of Art (August 16). The number of participants on each outing keeps expanding every year, and the number of outings in 2019 will probably grow from five to seven.</p>

<p>The effort has won <a href="http://www.rsvpdane.org/news/104-bus-buddy-coordinators-receive-united-way-and-jefferson-awards" target="_blank">awards</a>. RSVP's Bus Buddy Coordinators, Susan Morrison, Heather Johnson, Bruce Verhelst, and Angela Haskin were awarded the 2018 United Way Distinguished Service Award
(see picture). Heather Johnson additionally won WKOWs <a href="https://wkow.com/news/2018/05/25/jefferson-award-winner-may-2018-heather-johnson/#?autoStart=true&amp;topVideoCatNo=default&amp;clipId=14379545" target="_blank">2018 Jefferson Award</span></a>. She has been an RSVP Bus Buddy since the beginning in 2014.</p>

<p>The Bus Buddy idea seems so simple and basic to reducing social isolation and increasing bus ridership that it is surprising that RSVPs effort appears unique. The program that comes closest to it elsewhere in Wisconsin but is run by the transit agency itself rather than by volunteers is that of <a href="http://shorelinemetro.com/rider-services/bus-buddy-program/" target="_blank">Shoreline Metro</a></span> (for Sheboygan, Sheboygan Falls and Kohler).</p>

<p>Other than that and more multimodal in scope are the Travel Trainers and <a href="https://nationalcenterformobilitymanagement.org/for-mobility-managers/" target="_blank">MobilityManagers</a> employed by various agencies (but not Madisons Metro Transit). Hence the need for RSVP to step in. It asks and says:</p>
<blockquote><i>Want to have fun coaching and training others to navigate the Madison Metro Bus System?<br />
Want the satisfaction of helping others become more independent and mobile?
<br />
Want to meet new friends, go new places and see new things?</blockquote></i>
<p>If you answered yes to these questions, being a volunteer Bus Buddy Coordinator may be right for you!</p>

<p>The program is always looking for volunteers. People interested in becoming a Bus Buddy Coordinator should contact Diana Jost at<a href="mailto:Djost@rsvpdane.org">Djost@rsvpdane.org</a> or 608-441-1393, or Jan Karst at <a href="mailto:Jkarst@rsvpdane.org">Jkarst@rsvpdane.org</a> or 608-441-7891.</p>
