<h3>Transit insights from Denver</h3>
<br/>
<em>BEN FISCHER<br/>
WI State Journal<br/>
Feb. 3, 2006</em>
<p>Of all the far-reaching, "big picture" policy questions facing Dane County's fledgling Collaboration Council, the issue many members talked about Friday at the end of their Denver trip was one not even on the agenda: transportation.
<p>
The council, composed of some of Dane County's most powerful political, business and education leaders, went to Colorado's capital city to learn how that region learned to cooperate for economic development.
<p>
The 53 travelers, including four mayors and eight chief executives, heard from their counterparts in Denver about how that region does things.
<p>
For example, they have a "no compete" agreement for new business recruitment and a multi-county "Scientific and Cultural Facilities" taxing district.
<p>
But atop the list of Dane County Executive Kathleen Falk's list was the Denver region's commitment to regional transportation solutions.
<p>
"There is a commuter rail system that had enormous enthusiasm and public tax support from all the suburbs surrounding the city of Denver," Falk said.
<p>
Transportation is a conspicuous, albeit intentional, hole in the council's five-part agenda for improving the economic health of the Dane County.
<p>
Organizers have said they want to focus on less controversial efforts like work force development and quality of life first, and then become vocal in more controversial issues.
<p>
But Denver's light rail system caught the eye of Madison Mayor Dave Cieslewicz, who along with Falk has long championed expanded public transportation. Cieslewicz said he was most impressed with the Denver area's approach to transportation planning.
<p>
Instead of installing the commuter rail where population is already dense, he said, they've put it where they hope growth will occur.
<p>
"They're encouraging the transferring of development," he said.
<p>
Jennifer Alexander, president of the Greater Madison Chamber of Commerce, said the Collaboration Council will take up transportation in due time, even if it's not one of the originally stated goals.
<p>
To highlight her point, Alexander borrowed a term used by the Denver people: "ad hoc- cracy" - that is, when important, intelligent people get together their thoughts spawn new, unplanned initiatives.
<p>
But, as Collaboration Council members were quick to point out, the Madison area already works regionally on certain issues of concern.
<p>
Madison Gas and Electric Co. CEO Gary Wolter highlighted the Dane County Clean Air Coalition as an example, and Cieslewicz mentioned his recent decision to enter Madison into the Dane County Cities and Villages Association.</p>
