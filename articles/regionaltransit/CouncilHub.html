<h2>Apartments, retail space to replace Badger Bus depot</h2>
<h4><strong>Chris Rickert<br/>
Wisconsin State Journal<br/>
July 8<br/>
2009</strong></h4>

<p>Downtowns Badger Bus depot will close at the end of August to make way for 82 apartments and 11,500 square feet of retail space after the City Council unanimously approved the redevelopment plan Tuesday night.</p>
<p>Although the project, consisting of three buildings and an underground parking garage set on a one-acre lot, will be a dramatic change from whats at 2 S. Bedford St. now, most of the discussion during the two-hour public hearing Tuesday centered on how the demise of the depot fit into the broader need for a transportation center for buses and possibly trains.</p>
<p>Susan De Vos, of Madison Area Bus Advocates, was among several people who urged the council not to OK the redevelopment plan until the city had identified a site for a future transit hub. She suggested the depots current location might be a good fit.</p>
<p>"The depot could well become part of a new Downtown multimodal terminal," she said.</p>
<p>But David Meier, one of the co-owners of the family-run Badger Coaches, said bus company-owned depots are an anachronism and that customers prefer to buy tickets online or over the phone and to board in more convenient locations.</p>
<p>Badger is "quite behind the times" in keeping the depot, he said.</p>
<p>The company, which is proposing the apartment project, has a letter of agreement with the owners of the Mobil station across the street at 636 W. Washington Ave. to pick up passengers there, said John Meier, another co-owner, and will continue to make stops at Memorial Union and wants to use the Dutch Mill Park and Ride near the Beltline and Stoughton Road.</p>
<p>Still unclear is where Greyhound  which also uses the Bedford Street depot  will make its stops. The Meiers and Ray Harmon of the mayors office said the company is considering Dutch Mill and the Metro Bus East Transfer Point as alternatives.</p>
<p>Alderman Mike Verveer, whose 4th District includes the depot, said the apartment project has been under review since last year and that the neighborhood is strongly in support of it.</p>
<p>"The only issue  and I admit its a big one  is the future of inner city bus service" and a future transit terminal, he said.</p>
<p>He also pointed out that the city attorney had said it would be inappropriate for the council to make approval of the depot redevelopment contingent on finding a location for a new terminal.</p>
<p>The council did agree to an amendment to the plan that requires the mayors office and city staff to report back to the council in 60 days with details on where Greyhound and other bus providers will be picking up and dropping off passengers after the demise of the Badger depot.</p>
