<h1 align="center">Rethinking Rail</h1>
<h4 align="center">Fred Jandt, Editor of Mass Transit Magazine<br/>
           Friday Sept. 3, 2010</h4>



Im a rail guy  always have been. I can remember my first ride on Amtrak with classmates when I was in elementary school. And having traveled around the country seeing some of the best rail transit has to offer. And yet, Ive recently started to question whether its the best option.
<p>
As usual in a position like mine, you get a lot of things sent to you to read. A lot. I finally got around to reading an article called Mass Transit: The Great Train Robbery this week that was engaging on a couple levels.
<p>
At first, I dismissed this as anti-transit propaganda. For the editor of a transit magazine youd be surprised how much anti-transit stuff I get. I suppose they figure if they can turn me against transit, they can turn anyone. Fat chance.
<p>
But as I dug into the article a little more, I realized that it really wasnt anti-transit. It was more anti-rail, and even then it wasnt the usual shouting about no one riding trains or youre taking my car when you pry it from my cold dead hands, that I normally get.
<p>
No, this piece was more carefully considered with numbers to back up the writers arguments. Now, I know how numbers can be manipulated to work against transit. I see that everyday from the anti-transit groups. Still, it got me thinking.
<p>
Rail is expensive. There is no way around it, when you start slinging that much metal at that kind of speed, it is going to cost serious money. But I dont think it is prohibitively expensive. But it may be something we need to rethink.
<p>
First of all, and I take offense at the writers use of the word boondoggle, I think we need to call in a PR agency to help with our high-speed rail situation. Having attended a few local meetings for the new rail line being built between Milwaukee and Madison and talking to many others, I can see that a large part of the opposition comes from ignorance (remember the no one rides trains comment above).
<p>
The Presidents vision needs clarification. We need to drop the idea of high-speed trains because, frankly, when you say it like that, dramatic background music springs up and you get that announcer with the deep booming voice from the 50s in your head.
<p>
Its a commuter rail line linking major population centers with others in a network to facilitate quicker travel on a mid-range level. Its not better than air travel when youre trying to reach the coasts from the Midwest, but if you want to travel somewhere within your region, it beats standing in a security line for an hour.
<p>
And on a local level, we need to rethink light rail. Having ridden the light rail in Portland, Denver, Baltimore, Minneapolis and other cities, I know how nice it is to just walk up, hop on a train and hop off at your destination.
<p>
Is rail within a city a bad idea? Far from it. But I am wondering if there are better options. Frankly, light rail vehicles usually are built like tanks, yet tanks have more versatility of movement. Within cities we need something in-between what we have for rail and what we have for buses.
<p>
The thing is that most of the movement has been made on the bus side. Buses have moved more toward trains than the other way around. We need a streetcar system that can operate like rail does, but still use some of the recent developments from buses (just look at what Foothill Transit did this week).
<p>
Frankly, it seems to me that we need to rethink rail. Its difficult because that seems to go against rails very nature  you put it on the tracks, it goes. And yet, thats what we need to do. Only then will I think rail get that public acceptance we really want it to.
