<h2>Proposal to remake Badger Bus terminal approved by Plan Commission</h2>

A proposal to redevelop the Badger Bus terminal site at the corner of West Washington Avenue and Bedford Street has moved forward, despite pleas from mass transit backers.
<p>
The Madison Plan Commission Monday night approved plans for 82 luxury apartments units and 12,000 square feet of retail space in three buildings in the Bassett neighborhood.
<p>
The development would force closing of the bus terminal at 2 S. Bedford St., but that issue fell outside the review of the commission.
<p>
"I don't like to see the bus station going away and that's not to say it's not an important matter," said commission member Tim Gruber.
<p>
Still, a half-dozen transit backers spoke against the project. In addition to regular Badger Bus service between Madison and Milwaukee, the station also serves 10 Greyhound trips daily.
<p>
"This is going to make bus travel that much more difficult, especially for people without cars," said Barbara Smith.
<p>
But Badger Bus co-owner David Meier said 80 percent of his customers now use the Memorial Union for a stop. Most customers today also buy their tickets online, he said.
<p>
"The industry has changed," said Meier. "Other than Greyhound, very few operators provide their own terminals anymore."
<p>
Transit advocates had urged a delay in the plan until the city moves forward with building a new terminal. A site has been identified at the Kohl Center.
<p>
Aside from the station issue, however, the Meier development project enjoyed strong support.
<p>
The three buildings in the project would range in height from three stories facing West Main Street to five stories facing West Washington Avenue. Parking for 110 vehicles would be provided underground or hidden behind the buildings.
<p>
"The Meier family should not be held hostage because the city of Madison does not have a multi-model transportation terminal," said downtown Ald. Mike Verveer, who backed the project in his district.
