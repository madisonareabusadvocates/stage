<h2>Madison needs to make downtown transit hub a priority</h2>

Dear Editor: Badger Bus plans to close its intercity bus terminal at West Washington and Bedford, redeveloping the space for commercial and residential purposes amid the worst real estate market in decades, and without apparent awareness that the Federal Transit Authority provides funds for the development of multimodal downtown terminals.
<p>
This demonstrates poor planning, a shocking disregard for the consequences of losing this facility and an unimaginative use of downtown real estate.
<p>
When the issue comes up at its meeting on Monday, June 15, Madison's Plan Commission should withhold final judgment on Badger Bus' redevelopment plan until viable plans for future intercity bus service have been worked out. City parking and traffic regulators and UW officials should wake up to what has been going on and to what Badger Bus thinks it can do in the future at university facilities. Instead of the current laissez-faire attitude, good intercity bus service needs regulation, use of Memorial Union facilities by the non-university public needs regulation, and we need good regional transportation planning that should come from a regional transportation authority.
