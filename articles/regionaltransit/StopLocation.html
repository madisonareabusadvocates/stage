Q: I'm wondering why some bus stops are placed at busy intersections, such as Whitney Way and Odana Road, and at Midvale Boulevard and University Avenue. This causes traffic in the intersection after the light changes. Why not put stops in the middle of the block?
<p>
A: There are a couple of reasons, said Julie Maryott-Walsh, marketing and customer services manager for Metro Transit.
<p>
A transit planner recommends locations for bus stops, which must be approved by city of Madison traffic engineers.
<p>
Bus stops at major intersections often serve customer needs for transferring to other buses or reaching nearby destinations.
<p>
For example, a westbound bus on University Avenue that turns left on Midvale Boulevard and then stops allows a passenger to cross University Avenue and catch a westbound bus to continue a trip, she said.
<p>
That stop also allows riders to arrive close to such popular destinations as the Sentry Food Store, Walgreen Drug Store and Borders Book Store, she said.
<p>
Metro Transit has about 2,000 bus stops in Madison and adjacent municipalities.
<p>
Busy streets and major intersections are not just for cars, Maryott-Walsh noted.
<p>
"They're major transportation corridors, not only for cars but for people who use the bus systems," she said. "They're major pedestrian corridors as well."
