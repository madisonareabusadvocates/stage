Dear Editor: In his Plain Talk, “RTA right on with plan for adding buses,” Dave Zweifel discussed the Dane County Regional Transit Authority’s plans to expand and modernize bus service in Dane County.
<p>
As an occupational therapy student, I support community access for everyone -- particularly people with disabilities -- who relies on public transportation to navigate the metropolitan area. Expanding bus service throughout Madison and surrounding municipalities would increase accessibility. The availability of new express buses from nearby cities and towns to downtown Madison would enable people to get to work, school and hospitals faster and more conveniently.
<p>
Furthermore, with the price of gas on the rise, an increased service area, improved bus shelters, and modern conveniences such as wireless access would make public transportation an attractive commuting alternative for many drivers, thereby removing cars (and carbon emissions) from our congested rush hour roads.
<p>
I urge everyone to support the RTA’s proposal to increase the county sales tax by a modest quarter percent to improve accessibility and service quality and reduce traffic congestion and pollution.
