  <h3>Laptop City Hall: Transit board aims for spring sales tax referendum</h3>

The Dane County Regional Transit Authority took one step Wednesday night toward holding a spring sales tax referendum by moving forward with a plan for expanded bus and other transit services.
<p>
The plan for transit notably does not include using any sales tax funds on commuter rail, a highly controversial project once planned to connect Middleton with the town of Burke on the county's east side. Rather, it lays out a potential "bill of services" from the RTA that includes several express buses between Madison and outlying communities, expanded Metro service in Madison and between Madison and other communities, a network of park and ride lots, expanded services for the elderly and disabled and general transit modernization, from WiFi internet on buses to more hybrid buses.
<p>
While the RTA has been working on the plan for about a year, one main reason for going to referendum this spring on it is to gauge the level of public support for the RTA before a Republican governor and  Legislature can make any significant changes to the body's enabling legislation.
<p>
1,000 Friends of Wisconsin director Steve Hiniker, an RTA member and one of the authors of the plan, says he does feel a threat hanging over the RTA's head with the new state government, although it's not clear yet
what changes they would seek and when. Recently, authority member Mark Opitz said he had heard some discussion around replacing appointed members with elected officials, altering what the RTA can fund to
include roads and requiring a binding referendum to administer a sales tax.
<p>
But, Opitz and Hiniker say, if the RTA sees referendum support for improving the region's transit and levying a sales tax to pay for those improvements, their hope is that the state government will be more hands-off toward the RTA. Under the RTA legislation passed by the Democrat-controlled state government in 2009, a referendum is not required for the RTA to levy up to a half-cent sales tax, but its members pledged to do so anyway.
<p>
&#0147;We're eager to present the best case in favor of the RTA,&#0148; Hiniker says. &#0147;We think that we've even addressed the most vocal critics who have really focused on rail.&#0148;
<p>
Opitz adds the body was careful to craft a realistic, financially responsible plan that could work with either a quarter-cent or half-cent sales tax. Rough estimates of a quarter-center sales tax increase within
> the RTA's boundaries, which include about 85 percent of the county's population, add up to $15 to $17 million annually, while a half-cent increase could net the RTA $30 to $34 million. The transit plan proposed
has an annual cost of $9.7 million to $13 million.
<p>
A quarter-cent sales tax may be an easier sell. One speaker at Wednesday's meeting, Royce Williams, noted that the RTA also needs the sales tax funds just to operate more effectively, as it's currently a volunteer body with no regular income source or staff.
<p>
&#0147;The whole idea that this board with no staff is going to lay out a plan > for the next 10 years is totally unrealistic,&#0148; Williams said. &#0147;I know you all have been working hard, but there's going to a lot that needs to be done to get started and that needs to be done to take the next steps.&#0148;
<p>
There's also a timing component to getting the referendum done this spring. The RTA pledged to hold their referendum during a major election, Hiniker says, and the next one after this spring would be November 2012.
<p>
The RTA's Plan for Transit Committee will finalize the transit plan at their meeting next Tuesday, after which it will be circulated for comment from local politicians and other members of the community. A public hearing will likely be held Feb. 9 to hear comments in person, but a time and location has not yet been set. To get on the spring ballot, the authority will have to finalize the plan and referendum wording by Feb. 22.
