Dear Editor: This is in response to Dave Zweifel’s posting alleging that the referendum on commuter rail didn’t make a difference since the question was too narrow.
<p>
Dave needs to be reminded that if the question hadn’t been placed on the ballot, the RTA would still be supporting commuter rail over expanded and enhanced bus service. We all should be thanking Eileen Bruskewitz and the others who helped her get the referendum on the ballot in 45 municipalities. Eileen is for expanded and enhanced bus service; that is why she has worked so hard to stop commuter rail.
<p>
Unless the proposed referendum excludes commuter rail, voters shouldn’t support it, or they will find the increased tax will be going for commuter rail -- not an expanded and improved bus system. Take a look at the members of the appointed RTA and you know what the outcome will be!
<p>
The problem is the RTA was included in the budget approved in the middle of the night with little discussion. It is very flawed! It doesn’t include all of Dane County, it doesn’t allow money to be spent on roads for the expanded bus service, it has a non-elected board of trustees that will be spending taxpayers dollars with no accountability to the taxpayers. It should be repealed and done correctly.
<p>
Demand for public transportation will go up if we have an improved and expanded bus service.
<p>
