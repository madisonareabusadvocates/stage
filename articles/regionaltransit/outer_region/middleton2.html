<h3>Middleton Looks To Hitch More Rides On Metro Buses 
</h3>
<br/>
<em>Wisconsin State Journal<br/>
Thurs., April 6, 2006<br/>
BARRY ADAMS </em>
<p>Middleton could get expanded bus service by this fall, but it won't include a large transfer point.
Instead, the city of about 16,500 residents will announce today that it would use three smaller transfer points, expand service to the Airport Road business park and provide hourly service to the city's neighborhoods already served by Metro Transit.
<p>
If approved by the City Council following a May 4 public hearing, the new service likely would begin in August or September.
<p>
"Our bus service will be more user-friendly for Middleton residents, visitors and the business community," said Middleton Mayor David Zwank.
<p>
The new service also would include expanded peak hour service north of Highway 14 and west of Parmenter Street; easier connections to Greenway Station, Prairie Towne Center and Madison's West Transfer Point and more frequent service from Middleton to Downtown Madison.
<p>
The expanded service is expected to cost about $41,000 a year and increase Middleton's transit budget by 20 percent. But Zwank said because of the efficiencies of the new service, it will seem as though service has been doubled for the city which, since 1990, has grown by more than 3,000 residents, added dozens of new businesses and expanded its airport.
<p>
"We want to provide Middleton with the service they want," said Metro spokeswoman Julie Maryott-Walsh. "What we want to do is be as accommodating as we can."
<p>
"This is an attempt to keep pace with our development," Opitz said. "We are growing."
<p>
Today's announcement comes as other communities in Dane County are studying bus service.
<p>
Sun Prairie and Cross Plains have been looking at commuter service, while Stoughton, Oregon and Evansville are in the midst of a survey on bus service. Verona started getting bus service in September when Epic Systems began to open its campus on the city's west side.
<p>
Middleton officials wanted to build a transfer point, like those found in Madison, at University Avenue and Branch Street, but a study showed the site was too small.
<p>
The city looked at alternative sites on Allen Boulevard and on the soon-to-be revamped Parmenter Street corridor but could not find an appropriate location, said assistant city planner Mark Opitz.
<p>
Instead, transfers will take place at Northbrook Drive and Century Avenue, Branch and University and at Deming Way and Gialamas Way.
