<h3>Will Buses Roll South Of Madison?</h3>
<strong>Communities Eye Commuter Service<br/>
The Capital Times :: METRO :: 1C </strong><br/>
<br/>
<em>Tues., Oct. 11, 2005<br/>

OREGON
<p>
Citizens and municipal leaders bounced ideas around Monday night here
at the Village Hall to get the public transportation ball rolling to
the area south of Madison.
</p><p>Representatives from Oregon, Stoughton, Brooklyn, Rutland and
Evansville formed a committee to study the feasibility of bringing
commuter bus service to Oregon and Stoughton.
</p><p>"This is something that will help relieve the highway system
over time," said Charles Miller, an Oregon resident. "And it is an
answer for people who are aging in place out here and still need to get
to Madison on occasion."
</p><p>Committee members' first charge is to take the concept back to
employers in their communities and learn about the needs of employees.
</p><p>Stoughton Mayor Helen Johnson expressed an interest in finding
out if enough Madison and Oregon residents work in Stoughton to justify
a reverse commute into her community.
</p><p>
"Our job is to provide jobs, goods and services at home and then make it easier for people to get to Stoughton," said Johnson.
</p><p>
Another immediate task for committee members will be to come up with potential bus routes as well as park and ride locations.
</p><p>"The park and ride is very popular," Catherine Debo of Madison
Metro told the committee. "It is a very useful concept for attracting
folks from the rural area to use the service."
</p><p>
Evansville Mayor Janis Ringhand asked Debo if Rock County residents would be able to use the service.
</p><p>Ringhand expressed an interest in a park and ride in Oregon,
noting that a 2004 survey found that 47 percent of Evansville residents
work in Madison.
</p><p>
Debo responded that public transportation would be open for any resident.
</p><p>A subcommittee was formed to write a survey that will be mailed
to residents in each participating municipality. Debo advised the
committee as a whole to make their survey as specific as possible in
order to get a clear picture of the need for commuter service in the
area.
</p><p>
Not everyone spoke in favor of bus service to these bedroom communities.
</p><p>"While this is a noble cause, we are already draining people out
of our communities," said Brooklyn resident Sue McCallum. "Not one tax
dollar should go into that kind of system. Your time, money and effort
should go into creating jobs within your communities."
</p><p>As Metro is a division of the city of Madison, an
inter-municipal contract would be formed with each city, village or
town that decides to participate in bus service. Hans Noeldner, Oregon
Village Board member and chairman of the new Public Transportation
Committee, estimates the cost of the potential service to be about
$50,000 a year, based on current bus service being studied in Sun
Prairie. The cost would be split among any municipalities that choose
to participate.
</p><p>
The next committee meeting will be at the Stoughton City Hall at 6 p.m. Nov. 16.
