  <h3>Madison360: On RTA, leaders choose to fight another day</h3>

<p>In my column this week, I wrote about how members of the Dane County Regional Transit Authority found themselves in a bind.

<p>On Thursday night, they chose realism over pugilism.

<p>The background: The RTA, a panel of local leaders, was deciding whether to ask Madison and suburban voters in an April referendum to support a -cent increase in the local sales tax. The money would have improved integration of bus service across the region. But in yet another act of dumbfounding overreach, legislative Republicans want to fast-track reversing the legislation that allowed the RTA to be created.

<p>Faced with that reality, the panel voted Thursday night not to put the referendum before voters in what could be an empty but gratifying political gesture. On Friday, I asked members for takeaway thoughts.

<p>Via e-mail, RTA Chairman Dick Wagner said the real battles will be over maintaining existing service given likely cuts in state transit aids, so the referendum could be misinterpreted as offering improvements not possible with the ground falling away under mass transit.

<p>&#0147;To me, having the symbolic vote on an improved transit system would be simply masking the real crisis and the real fight in transit funding that will now be on the table, which is how if we starve public revenues can we expect public services of any kind like transit to exist,&#0148; Wagner said. &#0147;My heart told me to go for the symbolic vote, my head told me that was a feel-good action&#0148; and advocates should roll up sleeves "for the real battles.&#0148;

Mark Opitz, the only RTA member supporting going ahead with the vote, still hopes members will reconsider before a Tuesday deadline for getting the question on the ballot. He offered a detailed e-mail rebuttal to those opposed to moving ahead. Here are two key excerpts. Opitz summarizes and then, in parentheses, rebuts the case for not having the referendum.

<ul>
 <li> Moving forward with a referendum could be counterproductive to efforts to prevent the dissolution of the RTA. (I can&#0146;t imagine that NOT taking action will have any influence over the same state elected officials who are willing to turn back gobs of federal money allocated for a variety of infrastructure projects.)</li>

<li> We could be scheduling a symbolic or &#0147;orphan referendum&#0148; if the RTA Board doesn&#0145;t end up retaining the authority to enact the sales tax increase. (But then at least the public will have had a chance to weigh in on the plan, illustrating to what extent they wish to tax themselves to fund transit service. Wouldn't this be a great demonstration of the "local control" that the majority party has long held as one of their basic tenets?)</li>
  </ul>

<p>We will close with the glum assessment of Madison Mayor Dave Cieslewicz, who expects really grim news on transit aids in the state budget. He e-mailed me Friday: &#0147;Once we see the governor's budget plus the potential hit on transit aids thanks to the budget repair bill, RTA might consider reconsidering even if it's symbolic.&#0148;

<p>Things just become more backward and bizarre by the hour.
