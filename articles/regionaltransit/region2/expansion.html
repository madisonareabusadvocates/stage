<h3>Bus Expansion In Middleton?</h3>
<strong>Plan Calls For More Service This Fall</strong><br/>
<br/>

MIDDLETON
<p><br/>
Madison Metro buses would expand service in Middleton this fall under a proposal announced today by city of Middleton officials.
<p>
Middleton neighborhoods with existing Metro bus routes would get hourly service under the plan, and new bus routes would extend to the Airport Road business park.
<p>
Metro's new network of Middleton bus service also would include three small transportation exchange points within the city.
<p>
The proposal, which must get approval from the Middleton City Council, will have a public hearing at 5:30 p.m. May 4 at the Lakeview Community Park shelter. If it is approved, the changes are scheduled to take effect in late August or September.
<p>
Middleton Mayor David Zwank called the improvements "more user friendly" for residents, visitors and the business community.
<p>
"We're expanding service in our business parks, we're making it easier and more efficient for Middleton residents to travel to businesses located west of the Beltline, and we're improving service levels along Allen Boulevard and between Middleton and Madison," Zwank said.
<p>
The expansion, depending on final routes and other factors, is expected to cost about $41,000 annually and would mean a 20 percent increase on what the city of Middleton spends on public transportation.
<p>
It would also mark another win for Madison Metro's efforts to expand into a regional transportation network, officials said.
<p>
The Lakeview Community Park shelter is on the Route 60 bus route, near the intersection of Allen Boulevard and Maywood Avenue. After the May 4 public hearing there, a Metro bus has been reserved to take attendees home.</p>
