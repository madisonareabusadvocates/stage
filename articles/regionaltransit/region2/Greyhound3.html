<h2>After a year, Madison Greyhound bus station is still in limbo</h2>
<h4><strong>Isthmus, Sept. 23, 2010<br/>
Joe Tarr</strong></h4>

<p>Roger Campbell has seen a lot of bus stations. The truck driver delivers rigs to places all over the United States, then hops a bus (or train) back home to North Carolina.</p>
<p>On his first trip to Madison, he had this to say about the city's nonexistent Greyhound station: "This is crap, to be honest with you." Campbell said this while waiting inside a shelter at the city's North Transfer Point, which Greyhound has been using since the Badger Bus Depot on West Washington Avenue closed in August 2009. "I thought they had a bus station here."</p>
<p>Campbell had a long wait. It was not yet 10 a.m. on a Friday, and his bus wasn't scheduled to arrive until 7:45 that evening.</p>
<p>The city may also have a long wait  for a new station. More than a year after Greyhound started using the transfer point on Huxley Street, behind Oscar Mayer, it has no firm plans for locating a new station.</p>
<p>"At this time, there's no new news," says company spokesman Tim Stokes. "I'm sure we'll look at all possible avenues. But our main focus at this time is to find a convenient centralized location for the people of Madison."</p>
<p>Madison Metro general manager Chuck Kamp says Metro has suggested places Greyhound might use but has not heard anything back.</p>
<p>Chris Klein, a mayoral aide, says he spoke with Greyhound officials who said they're interested in using the future high-speed rail station on Wilson Street as a bus depot. But before taking steps to make that happen, the city wants commitments from Greyhound and other users.</p>
<p>"There's no point in designing an inter-city bus station if the bus companies aren't interested in being there," Klein says. "It's really dependent on the industry."</p>
