Ijust got a press release in my inbox announcing the majority of appointments to the nine-member regional transit authority.
<p>
The release, which came from the County Executive's office, shares the nominees from County Executive Kathleen Falk, Madison Mayor Dave Cieslewicz, Middleton Mayor Kurt Sonnentag, Fitchburg Mayor Jay Allen and Sun Prairie Mayor Joe Chase, whose appointments would make up seven of the nine members on the recently formed political body. Appointments from the governor's office and Dane County Cities and Villages Association have not been announced yet.
<p>
Nominees must be confirmed by the legislative bodies for each executive, but right now, the board might look as follows:
<p>
    County Executive:<br>

    &nbsp;&nbsp;Kristine Euclide, Vice President and General Counsel of MG&E<br>

    &nbsp;&nbsp;Dick Wagner, Former Chairperson, Dane County Board of Supervisors
<p>
    Mayor Cieslewicz:<br>

    &nbsp;&nbsp;Steve Hiniker, Executive Director of 1000 Friends of Wisconsin<br>

    &nbsp;&nbsp;Susan Schmitz, President of Downtown Madison Incorporated
<p>
    Mayor Sonnentag:<br>

    &nbsp;&nbsp;Mark Opitz, City of Middleton Assistant Planning Director and Dane County Board Supervisor for District 26
<p>
    Mayor Chase:<br>

    &nbsp;&nbsp;Donald A. Esposito, Vice President of Land Acquisition & Development/ Executive Vice President for Veridian Homes, LLC.
<p>
    Mayor Allen:<br>

    &nbsp;&nbsp;Kimberly Warkentin, State Director of America Votes
<p>
My vote for "least surprising potential appointment" is Wagner, a former county board member who has worked on regional transit issues for at least 30 years. Does anyone on the list surprise you?
