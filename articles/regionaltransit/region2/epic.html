<h3>Epic, Verona To Provide Metro Route</h3>
<strong>3 Trips In Morning, Evening</strong><br/>
<br/>
<em>Wed. Aug. 10, 2005
By Ann Marie Ames for The Capital Times\ The writer retains copyright</em>
<p>The city, with the help of Epic Systems, is rolling out a giant,
diesel-powered welcome mat for the nearly 2,000 employees who plan to
begin work at Epic's new Verona campus this fall.
</p><p>The city has entered a two-year, $110,000 trial contract with
Metro Transit System to run the new Route 55 commuter bus service into
Verona.
</p><p>The city has entered a separate contract with Epic, which will
foot the bill. Additional funding comes from an $111,840 Reverse
Commuter Grant awarded to Metro Transit System by the state Department
of Transportation.
</p><p>"Everybody recognized the challenge," said Verona Chamber of
Commerce Executive Director David Phillips. "In the morning, when you
travel on County M, it's not good already. If Epic is bringing in 2,000
employees, it could put an enormous pressure on the roads."
</p><p>Service will begin Sept. 19. The route will include three trips
in the morning and three in the evening. Anyone can ride the bus, even
non-Epic employees. Riders may transfer to Route 55 from any point in
Madison served by Madison Metro.
</p><p>"Epic is not only funding service to their campus, they are
even providing for additional stops," said Verona City Administrator
Jerry Saeger.
</p><p>Transfers are free, according to Julie Maryott-Walsch of Metro
Transit System, so riders will not pay more for travel between Madison
and Verona. Metro Transit System can provide mid-day transportation to
regular riders in an emergency.
</p><p>
Now that the route has been established, the challenge will be to fill the bus, Phillips said.
</p><p>
<b>"Fifty-five percent of Verona residents work in Madison," said Phillips.</b> "We need to get the word out to them. We're going to have to demonstrate the value of this service."
</p><p>The city will use its cable access channel and Web site as well
as signs to promote the new route. Metro Transit will host a booth at
the Verona leg of the Ironman competition on Sept. 11.
</p><p>According to Phillips, the future of Route 55 is to provide
regional service to communities around Verona. One tool to provide such
a service will be for the bus to make a stop at the Park and Ride on
the east side of Verona.
</p><p>"That is absolutely part of the plan," said Phillips. "At this
time the Park and Ride does not have the infrastructure to accommodate
a bus."
</p><p>
Maps and details for Route 55 can be found at www.mymetrobus.com.
</p><p>
RIDING THE EPIC SHUTTLE
</p><p>Morning route: The Route 55 bus will leave the Metro Transit
System's West Transfer Point at Tokay Boulevard in Madison at 6:30,
7:30 and 8:30 a.m. It will make the 20-minute trip directly to the Epic
Campus via the Verona bypass on U.S. 18-151. The return trip to the
West Transfer Point will make stops on West Verona Avenue at Legion and
South Main streets.
</p><p>The evening route: The bus will leave the West Transfer Point
at 4:30, 5:30 and 6:30 p.m. and enter Verona via Business 18-151. After
stops along West Verona Avenue at Rita and North Main streets, it will
proceed to the Epic Campus. From there the bus will travel directly
back to the West Transfer Point.
</p><p>
On the Web: Maps and details for Route 55 can be found at www.mymetrobus.com. Service will start Sept. 19.
