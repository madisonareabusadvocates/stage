</div>
<div align="left">
<p><font face="Arial">The City of Madison is growing, and desirable things
placed farther out need to be reachable by transit, rapid transit. 
Rapid transit also benefits downtown by making transit attractive and keeping cars out of crowded
streets.  Transit-oriented development is not possible without the expectation of good, 
efficient transit.  Bus rapid transit, or BRT, could make other parts of
the city reachable for the crowd that travels on foot, and so, can lead to
redevelopment of such places as Mineral Point Road and East Washington Avenue.</font></p>

<p><font color="#800000" face="Arial" size="5">Why Rapid Buses?</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">There has been a lot of talk about different forms of
transit for Madison, especially rail.  The argument is, basically, that
people like trains, and if you want to get people on transit, give them
trains.  That is not totally correct.  What people want most of all is
good service.  They equate good service with rail because just about any rail
transit system is going to have good service.  The reason is that rail is
expensive, so if you're a big city like Chicago or New York, you can afford to
build the rail system and stock it heavily with trains.  Thus, rail service
equals good service, and people are attracted to that.  Financially, rail
starts making sense as the capacity of the system gets large since you can run
multiple cars with only one driver, the most expensive part of the train.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">Because of Madison's relatively small size, the critical
element is the minimum level of service.  That is, we won't be writing
timetables based on the capacity requirements, we'll be writing them to provide
a reasonable amount of service.  For rapid transit, 10 to 15 minute service
is really the minimum amount of service for a system to be truly rapid
transit.  Longer headways mean people need to plan their trips with
schedules, which most choice riders are reluctant to do, and waiting that long
for a vehicle makes the trip not seem "rapid".</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">So, in Madison, bus rapid transit gives us the most
service for our money, and service is what attracts riders.  These
maps connect the naturally occurring corridors in Madison.  With rapid
transit, people will realize that they can quickly and conveniently get from one
point on a corridor to another, something conventional buses don't allow. 
Madison could start a system like this with the red line, and gradually add
other lines that connect.  In time, I expect ridership to grow, and when
bus rapid transit can't keep up with demand, we can upgrade to light rail. 
BRT is a lot like light rail, but without the expense of the
infrastructure.  Buses could be electric with overhead wires (called trolleybuses),
will benefit from signal priority like a train, and such features as 
automated ticket vending for convenience and speed.  The most speed is
attained from having limited stops and operating in bus only
lanes.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">This is the normal process for upgrading transit in cities
around the world.  Rapid Buses could come to Madison soon, and be the catalyst for Light Rail Transit. 
Here are some examples.</font></p>
