<h2>Misconceptions cloud debate over regional transit in Dane County</h2>
<h4><strong>Wisconsin State Journal 3/31/2009<br/>
DICK WAGNER and J. MICHAEL BLASKA</strong></h4>

<p>Transport 2020 recently held a series of discussions around Dane County on the future of transportation.</p>
<p>We heard from people who said build more roads and those who said invest more in transit. We suspect our future is a combination of both choices rather than just one.</p>
<p>At those meetings, however, a few misconceptions and falsehoods repeatedly surfaced.</p>
<p>Misconception #1:
A Regional Transit Authority is only about trains.</p>
<p>In fact, an RTA would help fund buses, shared ride taxis and para-transit for seniors and those with disabilities. An RTA would allow for an increase in bus service without relying on the property tax. Revenue collected via the sales tax is more equitable because the 30,000 people who commute from outside of county every day and the millions of tourists and visitors who come here each year would be contributing to the transportation system they use.</p>
<p>Misconception #2:
An RTA is being rushed through without public input.</p>
<p>As mentioned, hearings on a RTA were held all over the county after many years of study. More importantly, both the county and city of Madison have committed to a referendum before any new sales tax is implemented.</p>
<p>Misconception #3:
Commuter rail would cost a billion dollars.</p>
<p>This is false. The estimated cost is $250 million with at least 50 percent to 80 percent ($125 million to $200 million) paid by the federal government. This federal match is done on a variety of road and transit projects and would have to be in place for the project to proceed. In addition, if Amtrak service from Milwaukee to Madison moves forward as it seems it will, the price tag could go down when the rail bed and intersections on the East Side of the county are improved.</p>
<p>Misconception #4:
Trains will cause increased traffic congestion.</p>
<p>The fact is a train only takes on average 20 to 30 seconds to clear an intersection and traffic impacts are minimal. And we have experience from other communities who have found a way to eliminate traffic delays by having the train wait for a signal change at key intersections.</p>
<p>Misconception #5:
An RTA would hurt the economy and the environment.</p>
<p>The construction, maintenance and operation of an improved bus system and commuter rail would create hundreds of well-paying jobs and boost UW-Madison's ability to add high-tech research facilities on campus, along the rail corridor and throughout the region. Hybrid diesel and electric train sets are now being manufactured en masse and would be a good fit for our needs. And one engine would carry a hundred passengers -- a substantial improvement over the one-person-per-car average in this community now.</p>
<p>Let's have a good honest discussion, not distortions and propaganda, as we together decide our transportation future.</p>
