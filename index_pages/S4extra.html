       Riders Manifesto (June 2010):</a></h3>
       <ol>
        <li>Public transportation is a basic public service for everyone ...There is no place for means-testing.</li> 
        <li>As long as there are no tolls for public roads ... there should be no fare for core bus rides. []</li>
        <li>Initial regional focus should be on improving and expanding the current system, the bus, as an efficient, 
            clean, convenient, safe and affordable means of travel in the Madison Area.</li>
        <li>Transit riders are not 2nd-class citizens; their input should inform transit and land use 
            decisions.</li> 
        <li>There should be at least 6 different types of transit runs including 1) core service running all the time, 
            2) extra commuter service at peak times, 3) express service with limited stops, 4) circulators and 
            shuttles, 5) paratransit, and 6) connectors to intercity transport carriers.</li>
        <li>Core service should run 24 hours a day, every day of the week, at least every 20-30 minutes.  Peak service
        <li>The Madison Area should have a downtown intermodal terminal for local bus, intercity bus, and intercity 
            rail.</li> 
        <li>Major transfer points should be bustling, vibrant centers of commercial and public activity.</li>

    Our Rapid Bus (BRT) plan consists of BRT vehicles
operating over these corridors and extending into the entire urbanized area. The runningway is generally on arterial streets with transit priority elements. Model systems include Kansas City Max, Las Vegas Max, Eugene Emerald Express, and Los Angeles MetroRapid. Service is frequent and all-day, with branded vehicles and premium stations spaced at one-third to one mile. The system is designed to incorporate
future conversion to light rail.  <span class="readmore"> Read
