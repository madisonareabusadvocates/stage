<h1> 2010 Strategic Plan for Madison Area Bus Advocates</h1>
<h4>Summary</h4>
  The <b>Mission </b>of Madison Area Bus Advocates is to engage in research, education, partnership, and advocacy with the goals of increasing bus ridership, expanding bus service, and improving the bus system as an efficient, clean, convenient, and affordable means of travel in the greater Madison area. We insist on social justice and aim to empower transit riders. In the short term, we focus on:
  <ol>
<li>Guiding a Regional Transportation Authority in the Madison urbanized area to initially prioritize the improvement and expansion of our current transit system, the bus;
   <li> Establishing a multi-modal terminal in Madison that provides for convenient downtown inter- and intra-city transit;<br/>
<li> Influencing the development of the next 5-year Transit Development Plan; <br/>
<li> Developing coordinated, market-based policies toward roads, bicycle paths, pedestrian ways,
transit, and parking;<br/>
<li> Encouraging transit-oriented research and education.<br/>
</li></li></li></li></li></ol>
<h4>Main Body</h4>
<p> <span class="indented"> The first priority in our vision of an area-wide
    transit system is for an improved and expanded regional bus system that serves
    more people, places, and trips throughout the Greater Madison Area, both
    in the inner core and in outer reaches. Good public transit supports the
    dignity and freedom of all individuals, creates an open, hospitable and welcoming
    community, respects the environment, opens economic opportunity to all and
    moves people to where they need to go. Madison’s bus system may be considered
    by some to be good in relative terms, but it is not adequate to serve as
    a baseline from which to compare anything. It needs to be vastly improved.</span></p>
<p> <span class="indented"> There must be a more open and democratic process
    to transit decision making. Too often, important decisions are made affecting
    the quality of service to bus riders without ever consulting the people affected
    by those decisions. This can range from safety on buses, to the nature and
    content of advertisements, to the re-routing, elimination or addition of
    a bus line, or to the placement or elimination of a bus stop or bus shelter
    among other things. Citizen advisory committees designed to provide lay input
    into management decision are often insufficiently consulted or, when consulted,
    bypassed if their recommendations are at odds with what other bodies want
    to hear. Since bus users are not second class citizens, their voice must
    be heard, and part of our mission is to empower and amplify that voice, making
    decision making more democratic.</span></p>
<p> <span class="indented"> A regional transit system needs a regional transit
    authority. The City of Madison has become a central city surrounded by suburbs
    that were independent localities at one time but no longer are. They are
    parts of an interdependent system. For historical reasons, the state legislature
    still needs to enable the legal existence of a regional transit authority.
    Among other benefits, such a body could provide the dedicated revenue source
    that would even out a balkanized tax structure and provide the assurance
    often required for federal or state aid. Government representatives from
    this area need to be more assertive of our need for a legal regional transportation
    system.</span></p>
<p> <span class="indented"> Ideally, future transportation schemes that involve
    road expansion or road construction will include lanes for transit ways that
    could accommodate express buses, streetcars or some kind of rail. Transit
    should be accepted as a real way to move people and should be considered
    when transportation planning is done. No significant transportation improvement
    should be undertaken without a serious examination of transit facilities.
    Capacity problems in the overall transportation system should be addressed
    with increased transit service before any road widening. At a minimum, this
    will require the coordinated effort of Planning and Engineering departments
    on the municipal, county and state levels. Madison Area Bus Advocates wants
    fiscally sound investment in our infrastructure.</span></p>
  The bus system should ideally include at least six separate types of runs that
  could use different size buses at different times for different fares: <br/>
<ol>
<li> Core or “Local” service throughout the day (including early mornings,
    late nights, weekends and holidays); <br/>
<li>Commuter service to and from communities outside Madison into Madison; <br/>
<li>Peak Hour commuter service with limited stops within the built-up urbanized
    area;<br/>
<li>Specialized services such as Metro+; <br/>
<li>Circulators or shuttles; <br/>
<li>Connectors to Intercity Transportation Carriers (train stations, bus hubs
    or airports).
  </li></li></li></li></li></li></ol>
<p> <span class="indented">At the moment, because Metro is functioning with
    insufficient resources, it is trying to design routes that serve more than
    one function or cannot offer the service at all. The result is that many
    people who would use the bus use another travel mode instead, including driving
    a single occupancy vehicle (SOV). Consider for instance the need for express
    buses. Residents of outlying areas should be able to take a bus that goes
    from a designated point directly downtown with only one or two stops in between,
    rather than having to endure a long trip on a Local bus that stops every
    few blocks and has to weave in and out of traffic. Few people will willingly
    endure an 80-minute trip compared to what would take 15 minutes by automobile
    or 20 minutes by bicycle. Once downtown, transit riders should find corridors
    where service is frequent and direct. And rather than needing an automobile,
    visitors should be able to take the bus everywhere, starting at the locus
    of their arrival to Madison, whether they have come by train, bus or air.
    Although there may be few travelers late at night, early in the morning or
    on the weekends, the only type run that is currently using smaller buses
    is Metro+ but there is no good reason that other runs could not. The only
    type run that is currently charging different fares is, again, Metro+ because
    most other service is some modification of a distorted “local” or peak-hour
    service. But there is precedence for express service and long- distance service
    costing more than local service.</span></p>
<p> <span class="indented"> Greater flexibility in charging different fares
    for different people on different routes (e.g. youth, adults, seniors, disabled;
    local, circulator etc.) could involve the use of Smart Cards. A reusable
    Smart Card would enable the fare box to deduct the correct fare without requiring
    the rider to have the exact cash on hand, have different passes for different
    runs or continually purchase monthly passes or 10-ride cards. Related to
    this should be the expansion of unlimited ride pass programs. A significant
    proportion of Metro’s business involves providing rides to people with unlimited
    ride passes but the number of institutions presently involved, both public
    and private, is small. Passes should become an expected employment benefit
    and an expected component of student college fees. Passes should be available
    through such civic groups as Condo associations and Senior Centers. Currently,
    there are tax incentives on the federal level for passes for work-related
    travel. They should be used much more than they are now. There should be
    tax incentives on the state level as well and our representatives should
    help promote this initiative.</span></p>
<p> <span class="indented">In the short term, there could be the implementation
    of a sophisticated "way-finding" program for transit users. This
    would include the existence of user-friendly route maps and schedules, good
    on-street signage and information which clearly directs users to designated
    boarding points at the proper time (and which clearly marks a stop as inoperative
    during a detour). Buses with alternate routes need to be labeled such, perhaps
    with characters such as A and B. There could be consideration of unique identification
    of major routes, services and associated transit vehicles, facilities and
    amenities. It is helpful to identify major routes with colors, for instance
    calling them “the red line” or “the blue line.”</span></p>
<p> <span class="indented"> Madison Area Bus Advocates helps foster research
    into issues of transit system finance, fuel efficiency, technology, regulation
    and successful transit practices elsewhere. This is done primarily by coordinating
    efforts with transportation, planning, communications and public affairs
    researchers at the flagship campus of the University of Wisconsin. The University’s
    Engineering College houses the Midwest Regional University Transportation
    Center. The University’s Nelson Institute of Environmental Studies offers
    a graduate certificate in Transportation Management and Policy, primarily
    to students enrolled in Urban and Regional Planning and Civil Engineering
    programs. The University’s La Follette School of Public Affairs offers a
    graduate program in Public Affairs in which system finance can be researched.
    This will be enhanced by our nonprofit tax status that enables us to procure
    funds with which to underwrite student internships and commission thesis-
    based reports. The University campus itself has an award-winning transportation
    department that balances the land needs of such facilities as dormitories,
    offices, parking, and classrooms.</span></p>
<p> <span class="indented"> There is need for better community education efforts
    regarding what does and could exist to counter the prevailing notion that
    automobiles are synonymous with transportation. This is hampered by the fact
    that many planners only think in terms of car travel, and even a growing
    proportion of Madison’s own households are not within access of a bus line.
    We are again fortunate to be the home of the University of Wisconsin’s School
    of Journalism and Mass Communication that has an internship program and a
    new Web-based news medium focused on Madison neighborhoods, Madison Commons
    (<a href="http://www.madisoncommons.org/">http://www.madisoncommons.org/</a>).
    Madison Area Bus Advocates also maintains a web site that has reproduced
    relevant fact sheets and articles from local newspapers, is involved in writing
    articles for neighborhood newsletters, writing opinion pieces and letters
    to the editor of local daily and weekly newspapers, and asks that all its
    sponsored research be summarized so as to post it on the web.</span></p>
<p> <span class="indented"> The current bus system needs better marketing,
    outreach and connection with the community. Better marketing would not have
    a competition for tickets to an event in Wisconsin Dells, as was the case
    in the summer of 2006, but would seek to advertise events in Madison hosted
    by a Madison business and accessible by a Madison Metro Transit bus. Better
    outreach and connection would solicit business involvement and schedule bus
    routes in conjunction with the start and end of work shifts. It could make
    the benefits of Commuter Choice better known to both employers and employees,
    would make more loan officers aware of Smart Commute, and would make more
    enterprises interested in becoming outlets for Metro passes and cards. There
    should be periodic updates for area elected officials and key staff, and
    there should be more effective use of feedback from users. System management
    should ride the bus at least once a month so they could see the problems
    faced by users firsthand as well as show users they care. Better marketing
    could involve displaying local visual art work on buses, at shelters, and
    at transfer points, including the art work of students in area schools. Better
    marketing could also involve displaying locally-based poetry. Transfer points
    could provide outlets for locally-based musical groups as well as vendors.</span></p>
