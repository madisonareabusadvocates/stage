<h1>Comment on Amendment to the Regional Transportation Plan 2030 re. Verona Road
	 August 13, 2009 <a href="VeronaRdPDF.pdf">(PDF)</a></h1>
<p>When the Madison Area MPO unveiled its Regional Transportation Plan 2030
		 back in the Fall of 2006, several people from the Madison Area Bus Advocates
		 testified that transit systems need to be looked at as a real way to move
		 people. We argued that no new road construction in this area should occur
		 without including plans for transit and we pointed out that transit could
		 take various forms all the way from high-speed rail to rapid or express buses,
		 to circulators and shuttles, to paratransit. As the current plan for Verona
		 Road has no provision for transit, we find it totally unacceptable. Transit
		 positively addresses highway congestion. Road widening is only a temporary
		 solution that ends in as much congestion several years later. Thus, instead
		 of a good Plan, we see an unimaginative and costly proposal to misuse public
		 resources on the order of $75 Million. How can the Madison Area and WisDOT,
		 with their respective stated goals and objectives for environmentally sound
		 and energy efficient transportation, do anything less than build in a transit
		 component to every major highway improvement project in urbanized areas? We
		 need a balanced transportation Plan in which transit is not limited to intercity
	  High Speed Rail (HSR).</p>
<p>There are many advantages to a transit system that substitutes for many
		 of the current Single Occupancy Vehicle trips that are economic, social, health-oriented
		 and environmental in nature. So why does the Plan ignore transit? The project
		 addresses one of the most congested corridors in the greater Madison Area,
		 but the Plan makes no mention of current Metro service on Routes # 18, #19
		 and/or #55. The corridor is also the perfect setting for the installation
		 of a Bus Rapid Transit line that could provide a good example of Land Use
		 and Transit Planning Policy coordination in Dane County. There is no existing
		 rail infrastructure available for a rail transit option With a rapid bus,
		 travel time could be competitive with that of an automobile but the traveler
		 could spend that time reading or relaxing rather than navigating a car through
		 traffic.</p>
<p>The City of Madison and Madison Metro will officially kick-off exploration
		 of Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) strategies at an October 1, 2009 forum. The forum
		 will include the consideration of BRT strategies that give preferential treatment
		 for express bus service in congested corridors and could address issues involving
		 Transit Oriented Development as well. This is exactly the time, during a major
		 improvement project, to incorporate provisions for future BRT and other transit
		 strategies in transportation plans. Right-of-Way plans and programs in this
		 corridor are not complete until exclusive lane treatments for BRT have been
		 explored and accounted for.</p>
<p>While the federal administration may only be slowly building up momentum
		 and funding allocation for urban transit initiatives, the State of Wisconsin
		 including Madison falls farther and farther behind the curve in advancing
		 high capacity urban transit projects, including BRT options in regional corridors.
		 Although WisDOT is looking into intercity bus transportation and several park &amp; ride
		 projects, in general it still currently giving little more than token support
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Madison Area Bus Advocates urgently requests a pause in finalizing the concept
		 of Verona Road expansion to ensure that every feasible measure to facilitate
		 BRT in this corridor has been incorporated.		</p>
