<h2 align="center">Possible Research Topics - Madison Area Bus Advocates</h2>
<p> </p>

  Reports should always have a summary limited to a page and it should recommend an action relevant to the Madison Area. 
<ol>
<li>The per person investment in roads vs. mass transit etc. on the municipal,
    state and federal levels for a resident of Madison and for a resident of
    Dane county.</li>
<li>Policy analysis of the economic costs of Madison being in a poor Air Quality
    area relative to the cost of having improved bus service.</li>
<li>Explain the dual nature of municipal, county, state and federal budgets
    and how Metro’s operational costs are part of one whereas road construction
    etc. is part of another. How does this affect the bus system?</li>
<li>Transportation and economic development.</li>
<li>Transportation and housing.</li>
<li>Policy analysis of restricting parking funds to pay for parking structures
    the way the City does, compared to a policy that would enable parking funds
    to help fund transit use the way the UW does.</li>
<li>Legal and policy issues surrounding the existence of a regional transit
    authority with taxing authority (this could help form the basis of a bill
    on the state level)</li>
<li>Policy analysis of statewide reciprocity – having a transit pass
    that would be honored throughout the State.</li>
<li>An outline of some “best practices” in other locales that
    Metro might try to emulate. Some of the innovations on the international
    scene that Metro might try to adopt.</li>
<li>Policy analysis of what other cities do regarding issues such as 1) bar
    closings; 2) special events such as football games; 3) connection between
    parking and buses; 4) transportation options of elderly people; 5) transportation
    options of disabled people; with the ultimate goal that Metro services could
    be improved here.</li>
<li>Evaluation of various fuel technologies such as low sulfur diesel (what
    is used now), hybrid, solar and hydrogen.</li>
<li>Political analysis (including a “Transit Supportive Report Card”)
    of local, County, State, and Federal officials re. mass transit in general,
    the bus system and a Regional Transit Authority. This would include what
    their priorities are regarding allocating funds for mass transit relative
    to other considerations. (Some often seem to talk out of both sides of their
    mouths.)</li>
<li>Analyze the feasibility of local area circulator service in city districts
    --- such as a west side circle that would connect shopping, homes, offices,
    etc in a continuous, convenient loop…. Smaller buses could be used.</li>
<li>Cost/benefit analysis of a Dane County or South Central Wisconsin Regional
    Transit Authority vs. the cost/benefit of a household in *this area* having
    to own one, two or more cars (includes a comparison of relevant tax assessments
    vs. the cost of a car)</li>
<li>Analyze this: What if there were several high density cores instead of
    just the downtown? Since there is a lot of growth at the edges, it may make
    sense to designate an eastern and western core. These could be by East Town
    and West Town, and would allow some tall high value buildings with views
    toward the downtown and isthmus. Having 2 strong cores to either side of
    the existing center would strengthen transit use on both sides of town and
    between the 3 large nodes.</li>
<li>The role, costs and benefits of buses in a larger mass transit system,
    including the pros and cons of bus rapid transit, with special focus on the
    Greater Madison Area.</li>
<li>Suggest something else</li>
