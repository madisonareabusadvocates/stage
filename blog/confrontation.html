For three nights on May 30th, May 31st, and June 1st, overwhelming force was used by riot police against demonstrators, peaceful and looting alike, in downtown Madison. The protests against police brutality were sparked after the police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis. Tear gas, pepper spray, flash grenades, and foam-tipped projectiles were used as phalanxes of police and national guardsmen in full riot gear marched down State Street. Dozens of people were arrested. Police and members of the National Guard came from across Dane County and as far away as Wausau. Many of those riot police arrived at the site of protests on Madison Metro buses.<br />
<br />
Madison Metro should not be forced to participate in these violent suppression tactics. It is a cruel irony that the very vehicles that many people of color depend on are being used as a tool to suppress their protest. A public transportation agency&#0146;s resources should be used to meet the transportation needs of its riders, not violent police activities. At least one bus window and two windshields were shattered during confrontations between police and protestors. Metro&#0146;s reputation is also damaged by its association with state-sanctioned violence.

<br />
Decades of research on violence at protests <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/de-escalation-keeps-protesters-and-police-safer-heres-why-departments-respond-with-force-anyway/">have shown</a> that when police escalate force
against crowds - clearing streets, imposing curfews, and deploying <a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-06-12/protesters-complain-about-excessive-force">so-called</a> &#0145;less-than-lethal&#0146;
weapons - they amplify the very violence that the use of force was meant to prevent. Under
Mayor Satya Rhode-Conway&#0146;s emergency order, the entire apparatus of the City government
was asked to participate in this escalation.
<br /><br />
This use of buses is inconsistent with the spirit and purpose of the emergency management
ordinance under which they were used. Madison General Ordinance 3.20 states that the
purpose of emergency management is &#0147;to minimize and repair injury and damage.&#0148; Instead, City
resources were repurposed to transport heavily armored troops and police carrying tear gas,
pepper spray, flash grenades, and foam-tipped projectiles.
<br /><br />
Elsewhere around the country, victories have been won in limiting the use of city buses in police
escalation tactics. Transportation agencies in <a href="https://www.kqed.org/news/11823807/muni-will-no-longer-take-cops-to-anti-police-brutality-protests">San Francisco</a>, <a href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/2020/06/05/metro/mbta-will-no-longer-bus-local-police-protests/">Boston</a>, and <a href="https://www.king5.com/article/news/local/protests/king-county-metro-wont-provide-bus-service-for-law-enforcement/281-cbd8f9de-f98a-4840-8599-263240e572f0?fbclid=IwAR3lVimRPRcTWEIeQcdOqKEttferuOVGXmLyEpQr1snY4MOyovAZe7uK5_0">Seattle</a> have
committed to end the practice. Drivers and their unions in <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-05-30/minneapolis-protests-get-support-from-bus-union">Minneapolis, New York</a>, and <a href="https://chi.streetsblog.org/2020/06/09/cta-bus-driver-alleges-he-was-disciplined-for-organizing-against-transporting-police/">Chicago</a>
have stood up in solidarity with protestors.
<br /><br />
In Madison, policy makers, Metro Transit, and its supporters should take a stand against
transporting police to demonstrations and facilitating mass arrests.
<br /><br />
Madison Metro drivers and their union, Teamsters Local 695, should denounce the use of buses
for suppression of protest. They should also commit to oppose Metro support of police action in
the future, and, if necessary, refuse to drive these buses.
<br /><br />
Madison Metro leadership, Metro Transit General Manager Justin Stuehrenberg, Director of
Transportation Tom Lynch, and Mayor Satya Rhodes-Conway should commit to end the use of
City buses to transport riot police and arrested protestors.
<br /><br />
Mayor Satya Rhodes-Conway has broad discretion over the use of City resources during an
emergency of the kind that she declared from May 30th to June 2nd. She should apologize for
the use of City buses against protestors on those nights and commit to not use them in the
future.
<br /><br />
The governing bodies of Metro Transit; the Transportation Commission, the Transportation
Policy and Planning Board, and the Common Council should write legislation to end this
practice by City ordinance.
<br /><br />
Citizens and community supporters of Metro should push those in power to end the agency's
involvement in the suppression of protests.
<br /><br />
A way forward began at the June 15th Transportation Policy and Planning Board meeting. The
body was unanimous in asking Transportation Department staff to work with the City Attorney&#0146;s
office to draft changes to the City&#0146;s emergency management ordinance and to Metro policy to
prevent the use of Metro buses in support of police activity in the future.
<br /><br />
This issue came before the Transportation Commission on June 24th. Newly hired Metro
General Manager Justin Stuehrenberg and Assistant City Attorney John Strange testified that
Metro has no authority to refuse a request for the use of buses during a declared emergency
under current ordinance. As a City department, Metro is directly controlled by the City whereas
other transit agencies around the country may have the independence to refuse such a request
from a municipality since they are under separate governance structures. Pre-empting the use
of buses in similar circumstances in the future would require a change to City ordinance to
prevent the request from occurring or to allow Metro to refuse such a request, according to Mr.
Steuhrenberg. Mr. Strange pointed to a change to section 3.20 of the Madison General
Ordinance, a change to the City Emergency Management Plan, and a non-binding resolution as
options for policy makers.
<br /><br />
Comprehensive language should be passed into ordinance by the City Council and written into
the policy of emergency management and Metro Transit to restrict the use of Metro buses to
peaceful activity.
<br /><br />
Police spared no expense to protect glass and merchandise on State Street. Little effort seems
to have been spent to protect protestors&#0146; bodies from vehicles. Some streets were blocked off
as a form of traffic control, but implementation of barricades was not consistent. A man and
woman were <a href="https://madison.com/wsj/news/local/witness-vehicle-strikes-bicyclist-on-willy-street-during-protest-over-george-floyds-death/article_26880e90-8c6f-54ab-8d7c-9f6d3eaad4cb.html">run over</a> by a woman driving a silver Cadillac SUV at Jenifer and Few St on the
first day of major protests, as organizers gathered half a block away in front of the home where
Tony Robinson was killed by Madison Police in 2015. On June 21st, the driver of a pickup truck sent a woman to the hospital after <a href="https://wsum.org/2020/06/22/hit-and-run-becomes-flashpoint-between-activists-and-madison-officials/">driving into a crowd</a> of 150 people at the intersection of
University and Frances St. On June 23rd, protestors were struck by motorists in at least <a href="https://madison365.com/arrest-of-activist-leads-to-protests-at-least-four-vehicles-strike-protesters/">four
separate incidents</a> during protests in response to the arrest of Yeshua Musa. Since the death of
Heather Heyer in Charlottesville in 2017, vehicle ramming attacks have been used against
protestors across the US, but police seem to have done little to prevent them. <a href="https://slate.com/business/2020/06/george-floyd-protests-cars-ramming-racism.html">Dozens of
incidents</a> have occurred during this current wave of protests alone, after memes celebrating this
form of domestic terrorism circulated online.
<br /><br />
Transportation policy in this country and this City has long been used as an instrument of
oppression against Black, Indigenous, and other People of Color. The widening of arterial
streets was the pretext for razing the Greenbush Triangle neighborhood in the 1960s, displacing
residents from one of Madisons&#0146;s only integrated neighborhoods at the time. Integrated and
majority minority neighborhoods have long borne the negative externalities of transportation
investment. The Air Force&#0146;s own Environmental Impact Statement pointed out that communities
of color will bear a disproportionate burden from noise pollution when F-35s &#0145;bed-down&#0146;s at Truax
Field.
<br /><br />
Decentralization of services, jobs, and housing necessitates access to a car for many activities
of daily life while households of color are less likely to own one. On Madison Metro buses, riders
of color <a href="https://www.cityofmadison.com/metro/documents/titlevi2017.pdf">transfer</a> almost 3 times as much as white riders, and are more likely to face commutes
longer than 45 minutes. Modern policing <a href="http://bostonreview.net/law-justice/sarah-seo-how-cars-transformed-policing">emerged</a> along with the rise of the automobile and the
imperative for traffic enforcement. The over-policing of drivers of color resulted in the death of
Philando Castille, Sandra Bland, Walter Scott, Samuel DuBose, and many other people of color.
<br /><br />
The spectre of the National Guard being called up to quash protests has been raised after
protest actions on the night June 23rd in response to the arrest of Yeshua Musa and 25 days of
inaction by the city. The Mayor, under her emergency management powers, still has the power
to call upon Metro again, or not. She should leave the buses in their garage and allow them to
continue their regular scheduled service.
<br /><br />
During these protests in Madison, pedestrians have been struck by motorists in at least 6
separate incidents. We need to do more to protect protestors from motorists and hold motorists
responsible for their actions. Metro buses, a lifeline for many in communities of color, have been
used in actions of state violence against them. The buses should drive for their riders and stay
in their garages for riot police. Beyond the protests, transportation policy has resulted in
massive negative impacts for people of color. The weight of our society&#0146;s asphalt, steel, rubber,
and cement should raise up our communities of color where up to now they have held them
down.
