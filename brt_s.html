<h1>The Metro Mover<a href="TheMover.pdf"> (PDF)</a> </h1>
<p>Madison needs Rapid Buses. We call our vision the M or Metro Mover. The
   City of Madison is too large to be served adequately only by a regular bus.
   Regular buses are important, but there also needs to be a way for transit
   to connect places outside the center of town in a reasonable period of time.
   Despite its lakes and isthmus, Madison actually has clearly defined corridors
   for good rapid transit. Below is a simple schema, the idea being that a pedestrian
   on East Washington Avenue should be able to easily get to Monona Drive, Park
   Street, University Avenue, Mineral Point Road, or State Street quickly and
   comfortably without a car. The alternative is deep, plentiful, and expensive
   roads and parking garages.</p>

<h2>Why Rapid Buses?</h2>
<p>In the Madison Area, rapid buses give us the most service for our money
   given our relatively small size. To be RAPID, 10 to 15 minute service is really
   the minimum frequency for a bus as longer headways mean people need to plan
   their trips with schedules. Most choice riders are reluctant to do that. Other
   features that make them RAPID include signal preemption, limited stops, transit
   only lanes along part of the line, and level boarding. In time, ridership
   will grow, potentially justifying an upgrade to rail.</p>
<p>Although the map emphasizes Madison, especially a Madison that could experience
   Transit Oriented Infill, the M also has the potential to provide green transportation
   to Madison’s surrounding communities. The Red Line may be extended to serve
   Sun Prairie and Verona; the Blue Line to serve Fitchburg, McFarland, and Stoughton,
   and the Y ellow Line to serve Middleton and W aunakee.</p>
<p>Many American cities have or are planning rapid bus facilities. This is
   not a slow bus. This is high capacity transit that is competitive with driving.
   Imaging is important, and while Rapid Bus vehicles could be standard diesel
   buses, they could also be articulated buses, electric trolleybuses, CNG powered
   buses, hybrid electric buses, or some combination of these. The rapid bus
   system could interface at stations with other transit modes, making transit
   a convincing choice for a significant fraction of the population.</p>
<p>Investment in transit has the potential to provide green jobs and reduce
   traffic congestion on Madison’s arterials. </p>
